  Deprecated legacy module.

  This module previously defined an Ash.Resource for model artifacts. It has been
  retired in favor of `Thunderline.Thunderbolt.ML.ModelArtifact`.

  The module is intentionally left as an empty shell to avoid stale references
  during compilation. It does not declare an Ash resource and is safe to remove
  once all references are gone.
