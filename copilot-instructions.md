This is a web application written using the Phoenix web framework.

## Project guidelines

- Use `mix precommit` alias when you are done with all changes and fix any pending issues
- Use the already included and available `:req` (`Req`) library for HTTP requests, **avoid** `:httpoison`, `:tesla`, and `:httpc`. Req is included by default and is the preferred HTTP client for Phoenix apps
### Phoenix v1.8 guidelines

- **Always** begin your LiveView templates with `<Layouts.app flash={@flash} ...>` which wraps all inner content
- The `MyAppWeb.Layouts` module is aliased in the `my_app_web.ex` file, so you can use it without needing to alias it again
- Anytime you run into errors with no `current_scope` assign:
  - You failed to follow the Authenticated Routes guidelines, or you failed to pass `current_scope` to `<Layouts.app>`
  - **Always** fix the `current_scope` error by moving your routes to the proper `live_session` and ensure you pass `current_scope` as needed
- Phoenix v1.8 moved the `<.flash_group>` component to the `Layouts` module. You are **forbidden** from calling `<.flash_group>` outside of the `layouts.ex` module
- Out of the box, `core_components.ex` imports an `<.icon name="hero-x-mark" class="w-5 h-5"/>` component for for hero icons. **Always** use the `<.icon>` component for icons, **never** use `Heroicons` modules or similar
- **Always** use the imported `<.input>` component for form inputs from `core_components.ex` when available. `<.input>` is imported and using it will will save steps and prevent errors
- If you override the default input classes (`<.input class="myclass px-2 py-1 rounded-lg">)`) class with your own values, no default classes are inherited, so your
custom classes must fully style the input

# Usage Rules

**IMPORTANT**: Consult these usage rules early and often when working with the packages listed below. 
Before attempting to use any of these packages or to discover if you should use them, review their 
usage rules to understand the correct patterns, conventions, and best practices.
<!-- usage-rules-header-end -->

<!-- phoenix:elixir-start -->
## phoenix:elixir usage
## Elixir guidelines

- Elixir lists **do not support index based access via the access syntax**

  **Never do this (invalid)**:

      i = 0
      mylist = ["blue", "green"]
      mylist[i]

  Instead, **always** use `Enum.at`, pattern matching, or `List` for index based list access, ie:

      i = 0
      mylist = ["blue", "green"]
      Enum.at(mylist, i)

- Elixir variables are immutable, but can be rebound, so for block expressions like `if`, `case`, `cond`, etc
  you *must* bind the result of the expression to a variable if you want to use it and you CANNOT rebind the result inside the expression, ie:

      # INVALID: we are rebinding inside the `if` and the result never gets assigned
      if connected?(socket) do
        socket = assign(socket, :val, val)
      end

      # VALID: we rebind the result of the `if` to a new variable
      socket =
        if connected?(socket) do
          assign(socket, :val, val)
        end

- **Never** nest multiple modules in the same file as it can cause cyclic dependencies and compilation errors
- **Never** use map access syntax (`changeset[:field]`) on structs as they do not implement the Access behaviour by default. For regular structs, you **must** access the fields directly, such as `my_struct.field` or use higher level APIs that are available on the struct if they exist, `Ecto.Changeset.get_field/2` for changesets
- Elixir's standard library has everything necessary for date and time manipulation. Familiarize yourself with the common `Time`, `Date`, `DateTime`, and `Calendar` interfaces by accessing their documentation as necessary. **Never** install additional dependencies unless asked or for date/time parsing (which you can use the `date_time_parser` package)
- Don't use `String.to_atom/1` on user input (memory leak risk)
- Predicate function names should not start with `is_` and should end in a question mark. Names like `is_thing` should be reserved for guards
- Elixir's builtin OTP primitives like `DynamicSupervisor` and `Registry`, require names in the child spec, such as `{DynamicSupervisor, name: MyApp.MyDynamicSup}`, then you can use `DynamicSupervisor.start_child(MyApp.MyDynamicSup, child_spec)`
- Use `Task.async_stream(collection, callback, options)` for concurrent enumeration with back-pressure. The majority of times you will want to pass `timeout: :infinity` as option

## Mix guidelines

- Read the docs and options before using tasks (by using `mix help task_name`)
- To debug test failures, run tests in a specific file with `mix test test/my_test.exs` or run all previously failed tests with `mix test --failed`
- `mix deps.clean --all` is **almost never needed**. **Avoid** using it unless you have good reason

<!-- phoenix:elixir-end -->
<!-- phoenix:phoenix-start -->
## phoenix:phoenix usage
## Phoenix guidelines

- Remember Phoenix router `scope` blocks include an optional alias which is prefixed for all routes within the scope. **Always** be mindful of this when creating routes within a scope to avoid duplicate module prefixes.

- You **never** need to create your own `alias` for route definitions! The `scope` provides the alias, ie:

      scope "/admin", AppWeb.Admin do
        pipe_through :browser

        live "/users", UserLive, :index
      end

  the UserLive route would point to the `AppWeb.Admin.UserLive` module

- `Phoenix.View` no longer is needed or included with Phoenix, don't use it

<!-- phoenix:phoenix-end -->
<!-- phoenix:ecto-start -->
## phoenix:ecto usage
## Ecto Guidelines

- **Always** preload Ecto associations in queries when they'll be accessed in templates, ie a message that needs to reference the `message.user.email`
- Remember `import Ecto.Query` and other supporting modules when you write `seeds.exs`
- `Ecto.Schema` fields always use the `:string` type, even for `:text`, columns, ie: `field :name, :string`
- `Ecto.Changeset.validate_number/2` **DOES NOT SUPPORT the `:allow_nil` option**. By default, Ecto validations only run if a change for the given field exists and the change value is not nil, so such as option is never needed
- You **must** use `Ecto.Changeset.get_field(changeset, :field)` to access changeset fields
- Fields which are set programatically, such as `user_id`, must not be listed in `cast` calls or similar for security purposes. Instead they must be explicitly set when creating the struct

<!-- phoenix:ecto-end -->
<!-- phoenix:html-start -->
## phoenix:html usage
## Phoenix HTML guidelines

- Phoenix templates **always** use `~H` or .html.heex files (known as HEEx), **never** use `~E`
- **Always** use the imported `Phoenix.Component.form/1` and `Phoenix.Component.inputs_for/1` function to build forms. **Never** use `Phoenix.HTML.form_for` or `Phoenix.HTML.inputs_for` as they are outdated
- When building forms **always** use the already imported `Phoenix.Component.to_form/2` (`assign(socket, form: to_form(...))` and `<.form for={@form} id="msg-form">`), then access those forms in the template via `@form[:field]`
- **Always** add unique DOM IDs to key elements (like forms, buttons, etc) when writing templates, these IDs can later be used in tests (`<.form for={@form} id="product-form">`)
- For "app wide" template imports, you can import/alias into the `my_app_web.ex`'s `html_helpers` block, so they will be available to all LiveViews, LiveComponent's, and all modules that do `use MyAppWeb, :html` (replace "my_app" by the actual app name)

- Elixir supports `if/else` but **does NOT support `if/else if` or `if/elsif`. **Never use `else if` or `elseif` in Elixir**, **always** use `cond` or `case` for multiple conditionals.

  **Never do this (invalid)**:

      <%= if condition do %>
        ...
      <% else if other_condition %>
        ...
      <% end %>

  Instead **always** do this:

      <%= cond do %>
        <% condition -> %>
          ...
        <% condition2 -> %>
          ...
        <% true -> %>
          ...
      <% end %>

- HEEx require special tag annotation if you want to insert literal curly's like `{` or `}`. If you want to show a textual code snippet on the page in a `<pre>` or `<code>` block you *must* annotate the parent tag with `phx-no-curly-interpolation`:

      <code phx-no-curly-interpolation>
        let obj = {key: "val"}
      </code>

  Within `phx-no-curly-interpolation` annotated tags, you can use `{` and `}` without escaping them, and dynamic Elixir expressions can still be used with `<%= ... %>` syntax

- HEEx class attrs support lists, but you must **always** use list `[...]` syntax. You can use the class list syntax to conditionally add classes, **always do this for multiple class values**:

      <a class={[
        "px-2 text-white",
        @some_flag && "py-5",
        if(@other_condition, do: "border-red-500", else: "border-blue-100"),
        ...
      ]}>Text</a>

  and **always** wrap `if`'s inside `{...}` expressions with parens, like done above (`if(@other_condition, do: "...", else: "...")`)

  and **never** do this, since it's invalid (note the missing `[` and `]`):

      <a class={
        "px-2 text-white",
        @some_flag && "py-5"
      }> ...
      => Raises compile syntax error on invalid HEEx attr syntax

- **Never** use `<% Enum.each %>` or non-for comprehensions for generating template content, instead **always** use `<%= for item <- @collection do %>`
- HEEx HTML comments use `<%!-- comment --%>`. **Always** use the HEEx HTML comment syntax for template comments (`<%!-- comment --%>`)
- HEEx allows interpolation via `{...}` and `<%= ... %>`, but the `<%= %>` **only** works within tag bodies. **Always** use the `{...}` syntax for interpolation within tag attributes, and for interpolation of values within tag bodies. **Always** interpolate block constructs (if, cond, case, for) within tag bodies using `<%= ... %>`.

  **Always** do this:

      <div id={@id}>
        {@my_assign}
        <%= if @some_block_condition do %>
          {@another_assign}
        <% end %>
      </div>

  and **Never** do this – the program will terminate with a syntax error:

      <%!-- THIS IS INVALID NEVER EVER DO THIS --%>
      <div id="<%= @invalid_interpolation %>">
        {if @invalid_block_construct do}
        {end}
      </div>

<!-- phoenix:html-end -->
<!-- phoenix:liveview-start -->
## phoenix:liveview usage
## Phoenix LiveView guidelines

- **Never** use the deprecated `live_redirect` and `live_patch` functions, instead **always** use the `<.link navigate={href}>` and  `<.link patch={href}>` in templates, and `push_navigate` and `push_patch` functions LiveViews
- **Avoid LiveComponent's** unless you have a strong, specific need for them
- LiveViews should be named like `AppWeb.WeatherLive`, with a `Live` suffix. When you go to add LiveView routes to the router, the default `:browser` scope is **already aliased** with the `AppWeb` module, so you can just do `live "/weather", WeatherLive`
- Remember anytime you use `phx-hook="MyHook"` and that js hook manages its own DOM, you **must** also set the `phx-update="ignore"` attribute
- **Never** write embedded `<script>` tags in HEEx. Instead always write your scripts and hooks in the `assets/js` directory and integrate them with the `assets/js/app.js` file

### LiveView streams

- **Always** use LiveView streams for collections for assigning regular lists to avoid memory ballooning and runtime termination with the following operations:
  - basic append of N items - `stream(socket, :messages, [new_msg])`
  - resetting stream with new items - `stream(socket, :messages, [new_msg], reset: true)` (e.g. for filtering items)
  - prepend to stream - `stream(socket, :messages, [new_msg], at: -1)`
  - deleting items - `stream_delete(socket, :messages, msg)`

- When using the `stream/3` interfaces in the LiveView, the LiveView template must 1) always set `phx-update="stream"` on the parent element, with a DOM id on the parent element like `id="messages"` and 2) consume the `@streams.stream_name` collection and use the id as the DOM id for each child. For a call like `stream(socket, :messages, [new_msg])` in the LiveView, the template would be:

      <div id="messages" phx-update="stream">
        <div :for={{id, msg} <- @streams.messages} id={id}>
          {msg.text}
        </div>
      </div>

- LiveView streams are *not* enumerable, so you cannot use `Enum.filter/2` or `Enum.reject/2` on them. Instead, if you want to filter, prune, or refresh a list of items on the UI, you **must refetch the data and re-stream the entire stream collection, passing reset: true**:

      def handle_event("filter", %{"filter" => filter}, socket) do
        # re-fetch the messages based on the filter
        messages = list_messages(filter)

        {:noreply,
        socket
        |> assign(:messages_empty?, messages == [])
        # reset the stream with the new messages
        |> stream(:messages, messages, reset: true)}
      end

- LiveView streams *do not support counting or empty states*. If you need to display a count, you must track it using a separate assign. For empty states, you can use Tailwind classes:

      <div id="tasks" phx-update="stream">
        <div class="hidden only:block">No tasks yet</div>
        <div :for={{id, task} <- @stream.tasks} id={id}>
          {task.name}
        </div>
      </div>

  The above only works if the empty state is the only HTML block alongside the stream for-comprehension.

- **Never** use the deprecated `phx-update="append"` or `phx-update="prepend"` for collections

### LiveView tests

- `Phoenix.LiveViewTest` module and `LazyHTML` (included) for making your assertions
- Form tests are driven by `Phoenix.LiveViewTest`'s `render_submit/2` and `render_change/2` functions
- Come up with a step-by-step test plan that splits major test cases into small, isolated files. You may start with simpler tests that verify content exists, gradually add interaction tests
- **Always reference the key element IDs you added in the LiveView templates in your tests** for `Phoenix.LiveViewTest` functions like `element/2`, `has_element/2`, selectors, etc
- **Never** tests again raw HTML, **always** use `element/2`, `has_element/2`, and similar: `assert has_element?(view, "#my-form")`
- Instead of relying on testing text content, which can change, favor testing for the presence of key elements
- Focus on testing outcomes rather than implementation details
- Be aware that `Phoenix.Component` functions like `<.form>` might produce different HTML than expected. Test against the output HTML structure, not your mental model of what you expect it to be
- When facing test failures with element selectors, add debug statements to print the actual HTML, but use `LazyHTML` selectors to limit the output, ie:

      html = render(view)
      document = LazyHTML.from_fragment(html)
      matches = LazyHTML.filter(document, "your-complex-selector")
      IO.inspect(matches, label: "Matches")

### Form handling

#### Creating a form from params

If you want to create a form based on `handle_event` params:

    def handle_event("submitted", params, socket) do
      {:noreply, assign(socket, form: to_form(params))}
    end

When you pass a map to `to_form/1`, it assumes said map contains the form params, which are expected to have string keys.

You can also specify a name to nest the params:

    def handle_event("submitted", %{"user" => user_params}, socket) do
      {:noreply, assign(socket, form: to_form(user_params, as: :user))}
    end

#### Creating a form from changesets

When using changesets, the underlying data, form params, and errors are retrieved from it. The `:as` option is automatically computed too. E.g. if you have a user schema:

    defmodule MyApp.Users.User do
      use Ecto.Schema
      ...
    end

And then you create a changeset that you pass to `to_form`:

    %MyApp.Users.User{}
    |> Ecto.Changeset.change()
    |> to_form()

Once the form is submitted, the params will be available under `%{"user" => user_params}`.

In the template, the form form assign can be passed to the `<.form>` function component:

    <.form for={@form} id="todo-form" phx-change="validate" phx-submit="save">
      <.input field={@form[:field]} type="text" />
    </.form>

Always give the form an explicit, unique DOM ID, like `id="todo-form"`.

#### Avoiding form errors

**Always** use a form assigned via `to_form/2` in the LiveView, and the `<.input>` component in the template. In the template **always access forms this**:

    <%!-- ALWAYS do this (valid) --%>
    <.form for={@form} id="my-form">
      <.input field={@form[:field]} type="text" />
    </.form>

And **never** do this:

    <%!-- NEVER do this (invalid) --%>
    <.form for={@changeset} id="my-form">
      <.input field={@changeset[:field]} type="text" />
    </.form>

- You are FORBIDDEN from accessing the changeset in the template as it will cause errors
- **Never** use `<.form let={f} ...>` in the template, instead **always use `<.form for={@form} ...>`**, then drive all form references from the form assign as in `@form[:field]`. The UI should **always** be driven by a `to_form/2` assigned in the LiveView module that is derived from a changeset

## usage_rules usage
_A dev tool for Elixir projects to gather LLM usage rules from dependencies_

## Using Usage Rules

Many packages have usage rules, which you should *thoroughly* consult before taking any
action. These usage rules contain guidelines and rules *directly from the package authors*.
They are your best source of knowledge for making decisions.

## Modules & functions in the current app and dependencies

When looking for docs for modules & functions that are dependencies of the current project,
or for Elixir itself, use `mix usage_rules.docs`

```
# Search a whole module
mix usage_rules.docs Enum

# Search a specific function
mix usage_rules.docs Enum.zip

# Search a specific function & arity
mix usage_rules.docs Enum.zip/1
```


## Searching Documentation

You should also consult the documentation of any tools you are using, early and often. The best 
way to accomplish this is to use the `usage_rules.search_docs` mix task. Once you have
found what you are looking for, use the links in the search results to get more detail. For example:

```
# Search docs for all packages in the current application, including Elixir
mix usage_rules.search_docs Enum.zip

# Search docs for specific packages
mix usage_rules.search_docs Req.get -p req

# Search docs for multi-word queries
mix usage_rules.search_docs "making requests" -p req

# Search only in titles (useful for finding specific functions/modules)
mix usage_rules.search_docs "Enum.zip" --query-by title
```

# Elixir Core Usage Rules

## Pattern Matching
- Use pattern matching over conditional logic when possible
- Prefer to match on function heads instead of using `if`/`else` or `case` in function bodies
- `%{}` matches ANY map, not just empty maps. Use `map_size(map) == 0` guard to check for truly empty maps

## Error Handling
- Use `{:ok, result}` and `{:error, reason}` tuples for operations that can fail
- Avoid raising exceptions for control flow
- Use `with` for chaining operations that return `{:ok, _}` or `{:error, _}`

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Elixir has no `return` statement, nor early returns. The last expression in a block is always returned.
- Don't use `Enum` functions on large collections when `Stream` is more appropriate
- Avoid nested `case` statements - refactor to a single `case`, `with` or separate functions
- Don't use `String.to_atom/1` on user input (memory leak risk)
- Lists and enumerables cannot be indexed with brackets. Use pattern matching or `Enum` functions
- Prefer `Enum` functions like `Enum.reduce` over recursion
- When recursion is necessary, prefer to use pattern matching in function heads for base case detection
- Using the process dictionary is typically a sign of unidiomatic code
- Only use macros if explicitly requested
- There are many useful standard library functions, prefer to use them where possible

## Function Design
- Use guard clauses: `when is_binary(name) and byte_size(name) > 0`
- Prefer multiple function clauses over complex conditional logic
- Name functions descriptively: `calculate_total_price/2` not `calc/2`
- Predicate function names should not start with `is` and should end in a question mark.
- Names like `is_thing` should be reserved for guards

## Data Structures
- Use structs over maps when the shape is known: `defstruct [:name, :age]`
- Prefer keyword lists for options: `[timeout: 5000, retries: 3]`
- Use maps for dynamic key-value data
- Prefer to prepend to lists `[new | list]` not `list ++ [new]`

## Mix Tasks

- Use `mix help` to list available mix tasks
- Use `mix help task_name` to get docs for an individual task
- Read the docs and options fully before using tasks

## Testing
- Run tests in a specific file with `mix test test/my_test.exs` and a specific test with the line number `mix test path/to/test.exs:123`
- Limit the number of failed tests with `mix test --max-failures n`
- Use `@tag` to tag specific tests, and `mix test --only tag` to run only those tests
- Use `assert_raise` for testing expected exceptions: `assert_raise ArgumentError, fn -> invalid_function() end`
- Use `mix help test` to for full documentation on running tests

## Debugging

- Use `dbg/1` to print values while debugging. This will display the formatted value and other relevant information in the console.

## usage_rules:otp usage
# OTP Usage Rules

## GenServer Best Practices
- Keep state simple and serializable
- Handle all expected messages explicitly
- Use `handle_continue/2` for post-init work
- Implement proper cleanup in `terminate/2` when necessary

## Process Communication
- Use `GenServer.call/3` for synchronous requests expecting replies
- Use `GenServer.cast/2` for fire-and-forget messages.
- When in doubt, use `call` over `cast`, to ensure back-pressure
- Set appropriate timeouts for `call/3` operations

## Fault Tolerance
- Set up processes such that they can handle crashing and being restarted by supervisors
- Use `:max_restarts` and `:max_seconds` to prevent restart loops

## Task and Async
- Use `Task.Supervisor` for better fault tolerance
- Handle task failures with `Task.yield/2` or `Task.shutdown/2`
- Set appropriate task timeouts
- Use `Task.async_stream/3` for concurrent enumeration with back-pressure

# Rules for working with Ash

## Understanding Ash

Ash is an opinionated, composable framework for building applications in Elixir. It provides a declarative approach to modeling your domain with resources at the center. Read documentation  *before* attempting to use its features. Do not assume that you have prior knowledge of the framework or its conventions.

## Code Structure & Organization

- Organize code around domains and resources
- Each resource should be focused and well-named
- Create domain-specific actions rather than generic CRUD operations
- Put business logic inside actions rather than in external modules
- Use resources to model your domain entities

## Code Interfaces

Use code interfaces on domains to define the contract for calling into Ash resources. See the [Code interface guide for more](https://hexdocs.pm/ash/code-interfaces.html).

Define code interfaces on the domain, like this:

```elixir
resource ResourceName do
  define :fun_name, action: :action_name
end
```

For more complex interfaces with custom transformations:

```elixir
define :custom_action do
  action :action_name
  args [:arg1, :arg2]

  custom_input :arg1, MyType do
    transform do
      to :target_field
      using &MyModule.transform_function/1
    end
  end
end
```

Prefer using the primary read action for "get" style code interfaces, and using `get_by` when the field you are looking up by is the primary key or has an `identity` on the resource.

```elixir
resource ResourceName do
  define :get_thing, action: :read, get_by: [:id]
end
```

**Avoid direct Ash calls in web modules** - Don't use `Ash.get!/2` and `Ash.load!/2` directly in LiveViews/Controllers, similar to avoiding `Repo.get/2` outside context modules:

You can also pass additional inputs in to code interfaces before the options:

```elixir
resource ResourceName do
  define :create, action: :action_name, args: [:field1]
end
```

```elixir
Domain.create!(field1_value, %{field2: field2_value}, actor: current_user)
```

You should generally prefer using this map of extra inputs over defining optional arguments.

```elixir
# BAD - in LiveView/Controller
group = MyApp.Resource |> Ash.get!(id) |> Ash.load!(rel: [:nested])

# GOOD - use code interface with get_by
resource DashboardGroup do
  define :get_dashboard_group_by_id, action: :read, get_by: [:id]
end

# Then call:
MyApp.Domain.get_dashboard_group_by_id!(id, load: [rel: [:nested]])
```

**Code interface options** - Prefer passing options directly to code interface functions rather than building queries manually:

```elixir
# PREFERRED - Use the query option for filter, sort, limit, etc.
# the query option is passed to `Ash.Query.build/2`
posts = MyApp.Blog.list_posts!(
  query: [
    filter: [status: :published],
    sort: [published_at: :desc],
    limit: 10
  ],
  load: [author: :profile, comments: [:author]]
)

# All query-related options go in the query parameter
users = MyApp.Accounts.list_users!(
  query: [filter: [active: true], sort: [created_at: :desc]],
  load: [:profile]
)

# AVOID - Verbose manual query building
query = MyApp.Post |> Ash.Query.filter(...) |> Ash.Query.load(...)
posts = Ash.read!(query)
```

Supported options: `load:`, `query:` (which accepts `filter:`, `sort:`, `limit:`, `offset:`, etc.), `page:`, `stream?:`

**Using Scopes in LiveViews** - When using `Ash.Scope`, the scope will typically be assigned to `scope` in LiveViews and used like so:

```elixir
# In your LiveView
MyApp.Blog.create_post!("new post", scope: socket.assigns.scope)
```

Inside action hooks and callbacks, use the provided `context` parameter as your scope instead:

```elixir
|> Ash.Changeset.before_transaction(fn changeset, context ->
  MyApp.ExternalService.reserve_inventory(changeset, scope: context)
  changeset
end)
```

### Authorization Functions

For each action defined in a code interface, Ash automatically generates corresponding authorization check functions:

- `can_action_name?(actor, params \\ %{}, opts \\ [])` - Returns `true`/`false` for authorization checks
- `can_action_name(actor, params \\ %{}, opts \\ [])` - Returns `{:ok, true/false}` or `{:error, reason}`

Example usage:
```elixir
# Check if user can create a post
if MyApp.Blog.can_create_post?(current_user) do
  # Show create button
end

# Check if user can update a specific post
if MyApp.Blog.can_update_post?(current_user, post) do
  # Show edit button
end

# Check if user can destroy a specific comment
if MyApp.Blog.can_destroy_comment?(current_user, comment) do
  # Show delete button
end
```

These functions are particularly useful for conditional rendering of UI elements based on user permissions.

## Actions

- Create specific, well-named actions rather than generic ones
- Put all business logic inside action definitions
- Use hooks like `Ash.Changeset.after_action/2`, `Ash.Changeset.before_action/2` to add additional logic
  inside the same transaction.
- Use hooks like `Ash.Changeset.after_transaction/2`, `Ash.Changeset.before_transaction/2` to add additional logic
  outside the transaction.
- Use action arguments for inputs that need validation
- Use preparations to modify queries before execution
- Preparations support `where` clauses for conditional execution
- Use `only_when_valid?` to skip preparations when the query is invalid
- Use changes to modify changesets before execution
- Use validations to validate changesets before execution
- Prefer domain code interfaces to call actions instead of directly building queries/changesets and calling functions in the `Ash` module
- A resource could be *only generic actions*. This can be useful when you are using a resource only to model behavior.

## Querying Data

Use `Ash.Query` to build queries for reading data from your resources. The query module provides a declarative way to filter, sort, and load data.

## Ash.Query.filter is a macro

**Important**: You must `require Ash.Query` if you want to use `Ash.Query.filter/2`, as it is a macro.

If you see errors like the following:

```
Ash.Query.filter(MyResource, id == ^id)
error: misplaced operator ^id

The pin operator ^ is supported only inside matches or inside custom macros...
```

```
iex(3)> Ash.Query.filter(MyResource, something == true)
error: undefined variable "something"
└─ iex:3
```

You are very likely missing a `require Ash.Query`

### Common Query Operations

- **Filter**: `Ash.Query.filter(query, field == value)`
- **Sort**: `Ash.Query.sort(query, field: :asc)`
- **Load relationships**: `Ash.Query.load(query, [:author, :comments])`
- **Limit**: `Ash.Query.limit(query, 10)`
- **Offset**: `Ash.Query.offset(query, 20)`

## Error Handling

Functions to call actions, like `Ash.create` and code interfaces like `MyApp.Accounts.register_user` all return ok/error tuples. All have `!` variations, like `Ash.create!` and `MyApp.Accounts.register_user!`. Use the `!` variations when you want to "let it crash", like if looking something up that should definitely exist, or calling an action that should always succeed. Always prefer the raising `!` variation over something like `{:ok, user} = MyApp.Accounts.register_user(...)`.

All Ash code returns errors in the form of `{:error, error_class}`. Ash categorizes errors into four main classes:

1. **Forbidden** (`Ash.Error.Forbidden`) - Occurs when a user attempts an action they don't have permission to perform
2. **Invalid** (`Ash.Error.Invalid`) - Occurs when input data doesn't meet validation requirements
3. **Framework** (`Ash.Error.Framework`) - Occurs when there's an issue with how Ash is being used
4. **Unknown** (`Ash.Error.Unknown`) - Occurs for unexpected errors that don't fit the other categories

These error classes help you catch and handle errors at an appropriate level of granularity. An error class will always be the "worst" (highest in the above list) error class from above. Each error class can contain multiple underlying errors, accessible via the `errors` field on the exception.

### Using Validations

Validations ensure that data meets your business requirements before it gets processed by an action. Unlike changes, validations cannot modify the changeset - they can only validate it or add errors.

Validations work on both changesets and queries. Built-in validations that support queries include:
- `action_is`, `argument_does_not_equal`, `argument_equals`, `argument_in`
- `compare`, `confirm`, `match`, `negate`, `one_of`, `present`, `string_length`
- Custom validations that implement the `supports/1` callback

Common validation patterns:

```elixir
# Built-in validations with custom messages
validate compare(:age, greater_than_or_equal_to: 18) do
  message "You must be at least 18 years old"
end
validate match(:email, "@")
validate one_of(:status, [:active, :inactive, :pending])

# Conditional validations with where clauses
validate present(:phone_number) do
  where present(:contact_method) and eq(:contact_method, "phone")
end

# only_when_valid? - skip validation if prior validations failed
validate expensive_validation() do
  only_when_valid? true
end

# Action-specific vs global validations

# Thunderline Core Usage Rules (Foundational)

The following guidelines codify how to interact with Thunderline's internal foundational modules. They complement (not replace) Ash & Phoenix rules above. Treat this section as the canonical contract for core infrastructure usage. New helpers MUST be documented here as part of definition of done.

## Event System (Thunderline.Event & EventBus)

Public contract (P0 hard guarantee):
- `Thunderline.Event.new/1` & `new!/1` – construct taxonomy‑aligned events
- `Thunderline.Event.normalize/1` – coerce legacy/broadway maps into canonical struct
- `Thunderline.EventBus.publish_event/1` & `publish_event!/1` – single entrypoint to enqueue events

Do:
1. Always build events with `Thunderline.Event.new/1` (keyword or map) providing at minimum: `:name`, `:source`, `:payload`.
2. Use taxonomy names with at least two segments (`system.flow.tick`, `ui.command.message_send`).
3. Pass `meta: %{pipeline: :realtime | :cross_domain | :general}` only when you need to override inferred pipeline selection.
4. Pattern match on `{:ok, ev}` | `{:error, reason}` from `publish_event/1`. Never assume success silently.
5. Use `publish_event!/1` ONLY when the event being invalid represents a programmer error you want to crash (test environments encourage this).
6. For high urgency events set `priority: :high | :critical` – influences pipeline table & telemetry.

Don't:
- Extend `Thunderline.EventBus` shim – call `Thunderline.Thunderflow.EventBus` through public functions only.
- Depend on removed batch helpers (`emit_*`, legacy cross-domain helpers) – iterate & publish individually.
- Forge events via struct literal bypassing validation.

Validation & Telemetry:
- Validator rejects invalid taxonomy or forbidden domain/category with `{:error, reason}` and emits `[:thunderline,:event,:dropped]` telemetry.
- Successful enqueue emits `[:thunderline,:event,:enqueue]` and publish latency `[:thunderline,:event,:publish]`.

### Event Construction Checklist
- Name fits taxonomy & reserved prefixes rules (see `EVENT_TAXONOMY.md`).
- Source atom matches domain (`:flow`, `:link`, `:gate`, etc.).
- Payload is a map (never nil / list / scalar).
- Optional reliability adjustments done via `meta` not by skipping required fields.

### Working With Legacy Inputs
If you receive external or legacy pipeline payloads:
```elixir
with {:ok, ev} <- Thunderline.Event.normalize(raw),
     {:ok, ev} <- Thunderline.EventBus.publish_event(ev) do
  :ok
else
  {:error, reason} -> Logger.warning("drop: #{inspect(reason)}")
end
```

## Heartbeat (Thunderline.Thunderflow.Heartbeat)
- Single supervised process emits `system.flow.tick` every 2s (default).
- Never start additional heartbeats; subscribe or filter events instead.
- Use Telemetry `[:thunderline,:heartbeat,:tick]` for metrics vs subscribing directly unless you need payload values.

## Blackboard (Thunderline.Thunderflow.Blackboard)
Purpose: Low‑latency transient KV store (scopes: `:global`, `:node`). NOT for durable data.

API:
- `put(key, value, scope: :global | :node)` – async cast
- `fetch(key, scope: ...)` – returns `{:ok, value} | :error`
- `get(key, default, scope: ...)` – convenience retrieval
- `keys(scope: ...)` – enumerate keys (avoid in hot paths for large sets)
- `snapshot(scope)` – returns full scope map (diagnostics only)
- `subscribe/0` – PubSub updates: `{:blackboard_update, %{scope, key, value, ts}}`

Rules:
1. Use `:node` scope for rapidly mutating metrics to avoid cross-process contention.
2. Avoid storing large binaries – upper soft ceiling ~10KB per entry (to keep ETS memory healthy).
3. Treat Blackboard as ephemeral; always tolerate cache misses.
4. Never store secrets or PII (no encryption layer here).

Telemetry:
- `[:thunderline,:blackboard,:put]` & `[:thunderline,:blackboard,:fetch]` emit count with metadata `scope` & `outcome`.

## Feature Flags (Thunderline.Feature)
- Static config in `config/*.exs` under `:thunderline, :features`.
- Runtime read via `Feature.enabled?(:flag)` (v2 API) which merges runtime config & compile snapshot.
- Temporary test overrides: `Feature.override(:flag, true/false)` and clear with `Feature.clear_override(:flag)`.
- All newly introduced flags MUST be documented in `FEATURE_FLAGS.md` and added to this section with rationale & planned removal/ graduation criteria.

Do NOT branch on a flag without a removal issue or expiry note.

## UUIDs (Thunderline.UUID)
- Use `Thunderline.UUID.v7/0` for correlation, event, and entity IDs requiring time ordering.
- Fallback automatically uses `UUID.uuid4()` if strong randomness/time generation fails.
- Never attempt to parse internal bit layout manually – treat as opaque string.

## Error Classification (Thunderline.ErrorClassifier / ErrorClass)
- Use `ErrorClassifier.classify(term, context)` to map raw errors to `%ErrorClass{}` shape.
- Include contextual keys (e.g. `:action`, `:pipeline`, `:resource`) in context map for richer telemetry.
- This is Phase‑1 stub: Do NOT persist classification results yet; treat them as ephemeral analysis.

## Repo (Thunderline.Repo) Boundary
- Only code within `thunderblock` domain or explicit allowlisted modules may call `Repo` directly (governed by doctrine & Credo checks). All other domains must go through Ash actions or public domain APIs.
- Never run multi-step business logic outside an Ash action transaction; rely on action hooks instead.
- Respect `SKIP_ASH_SETUP` env for lightweight tooling scenarios – do not depend on side effects during repo `init/2`.

## Event Priority & Pipelines
- Priority influences pipeline selection only when all other signals equal. High or critical events push toward `:realtime` table.
- Manual pipeline override: set `meta: %{pipeline: :cross_domain}` inside Event constructor for rare cases (document justification in PR).

## Telemetry Conventions
Name prefix ALWAYS starts with `:thunderline` root. Structure: `[:thunderline, <subsystem>, <event>]` or longer if hierarchical. Emit measurements as maps with numeric values; metadata as descriptive tags. Ensure each new telemetry event is documented here (table to be added once expanded).

## Process Guidelines
- Supervisable workers must expose `start_link/1` only; avoid custom `child_spec/1` unless specialized restart needed.
- Use `:transient` restart for workers expected to normally exit occasionally (none currently defined here; evaluate case-by-case).

## Adding New Core Modules
1. Define narrow public API (document here).
2. Enforce shape/validation at construction boundary (pattern: `new/1` + telemetry for failure).
3. Emit telemetry for state mutations / externally observable effects.
4. Provide safe `!` variants only when programmer error semantics apply.
5. Add quick usage snippet & anti-pattern list.

## Anti-Patterns (Reject in Review)
- Bypassing `Thunderline.Event.new/1` with manual struct.
- Calling `Repo` from non-Block domain modules (except explicit transitional allowlist).
- Feature flag conditionals without documented retirement path.
- Multiple heartbeat processes or ad-hoc tick timers duplicating system tick logic.
- Blackboard used as durable store or to share large structured datasets better served by database or persistent cache.

Future Sections (stubs – populate as subsystems stabilize):
- Observability / Metrics Source adapters
- Mnesia Producer contract
- Event Validator taxonomy expansion
- Policy / Actor Context integration rules

## VIM (Virtual Ising Machine) Consolidation
- All VIM helpers live under `Thunderline.Thunderbolt.VIM.*`:
  - `Audit` (Memento table), `AuditLog.append/1`
  - `IsingTranslator.to_lattice/1`
  - `PersonaAdaptor.build_problem/1`, `RouterAdaptor.build_problem/1`
  - `Telemetry.solve_start/2 | solve_stop/3 | solve_error/3`
- The old `Thunderline.VIM.*` modules are deprecated wrappers delegating to Thunderbolt. New code MUST use the Thunderbolt namespace directly.

actions do
  create :sign_up do
    validate present([:email, :password])  # Only for this action
  end
  
  read :search do
    argument :email, :string
    validate match(:email, ~r/^[^\s]+@[^\s]+\.[^\s]+$/)  # Validates query arguments
  end
end

validations do
  validate present([:title, :body]), on: [:create, :update]  # Multiple actions
end
```

- Create **custom validation modules** for complex validation logic:
  ```elixir
  defmodule MyApp.Validations.UniqueUsername do
    use Ash.Resource.Validation

    @impl true
    def init(opts), do: {:ok, opts}

    @impl true
    def validate(changeset, _opts, _context) do
      # Validation logic here
      # Return :ok or {:error, message}
    end
  end

  # Usage in resource:
  validate {MyApp.Validations.UniqueUsername, []}
  ```

- Make validations **atomic** when possible to ensure they work correctly with direct database operations by implementing the `atomic/3` callback in custom validation modules.

### Using Preparations

Preparations modify queries before they're executed. They are used to add filters, sorts, or other query modifications based on the query context.

Common preparation patterns:

```elixir
# Built-in preparations
prepare build(sort: [created_at: :desc])
prepare build(filter: [active: true])

# Conditional preparations with where clauses
prepare build(filter: [visible: true]) do
  where argument_equals(:include_hidden, false)
end

# only_when_valid? - skip preparation if prior validations failed
prepare expensive_preparation() do
  only_when_valid? true
end

# Action-specific vs global preparations
actions do
  read :recent do
    prepare build(sort: [created_at: :desc], limit: 10)
  end
end

preparations do
  prepare build(filter: [deleted: false]), on: [:read, :update]
end
```

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Validations.IsEven do
  # transform and validate opts

  use Ash.Resource.Validation

  @impl true
  def init(opts) do
    if is_atom(opts[:attribute]) do
      {:ok, opts}
    else
      {:error, "attribute must be an atom!"}
    end
  end

  @impl true
  # This is optional, but useful to have in addition to validation
  # so you get early feedback for validations that can otherwise
  # only run in the datalayer
  def validate(changeset, opts, _context) do
    value = Ash.Changeset.get_attribute(changeset, opts[:attribute])

    if is_nil(value) || (is_number(value) && rem(value, 2) == 0) do
      :ok
    else
      {:error, field: opts[:attribute], message: "must be an even number"}
    end
  end

  @impl true
  def atomic(changeset, opts, context) do
    {:atomic,
      # the list of attributes that are involved in the validation
      [opts[:attribute]],
      # the condition that should cause the error
      # here we refer to the new value or the current value
      expr(rem(^atomic_ref(opts[:attribute]), 2) != 0),
      # the error expression
      expr(
        error(^InvalidAttribute, %{
          field: ^opts[:attribute],
          # the value that caused the error
          value: ^atomic_ref(opts[:attribute]),
          # the message to display
          message: ^(context.message || "%{field} must be an even number"),
          vars: %{field: ^opts[:attribute]}
        })
      )
    }
  end
end
```

- **Avoid redundant validations** - Don't add validations that duplicate attribute constraints:
  ```elixir
  # WRONG - redundant validation
  attribute :name, :string do
    allow_nil? false
    constraints min_length: 1
  end

  validate present(:name) do  # Redundant! allow_nil? false already handles this
    message "Name is required"
  end

  validate attribute_does_not_equal(:name, "") do  # Redundant! min_length: 1 already handles this
    message "Name cannot be empty"
  end

  # CORRECT - let attribute constraints handle basic validation
  attribute :name, :string do
    allow_nil? false
    constraints min_length: 1
  end
  ```

### Using Changes

Changes allow you to modify the changeset before it gets processed by an action. Unlike validations, changes can manipulate attribute values, add attributes, or perform other data transformations.

Common change patterns:

```elixir
# Built-in changes with conditions
change set_attribute(:status, "pending")
change relate_actor(:creator) do
  where present(:actor)
end
change atomic_update(:counter, expr(^counter + 1))

# Action-specific vs global changes
actions do
  create :sign_up do
    change set_attribute(:joined_at, expr(now()))  # Only for this action
  end
end

changes do
  change set_attribute(:updated_at, expr(now())), on: :update  # Multiple actions
  change manage_relationship(:items, type: :append), on: [:create, :update]
end
```

- Create **custom change modules** for reusable transformation logic:
  ```elixir
  defmodule MyApp.Changes.SlugifyTitle do
    use Ash.Resource.Change

    def change(changeset, _opts, _context) do
      title = Ash.Changeset.get_attribute(changeset, :title)

      if title do
        slug = title |> String.downcase() |> String.replace(~r/[^a-z0-9]+/, "-")
        Ash.Changeset.change_attribute(changeset, :slug, slug)
      else
        changeset
      end
    end
  end

  # Usage in resource:
  change {MyApp.Changes.SlugifyTitle, []}
  ```

- Create a **change module with lifecycle hooks** to handle complex multi-step operations:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Changes.ProcessOrder do
  use Ash.Resource.Change

  def change(changeset, _opts, context) do
    changeset
    |> Ash.Changeset.before_transaction(fn changeset ->
      # Runs before the transaction starts
      # Use for external API calls, logging, etc.
      MyApp.ExternalService.reserve_inventory(changeset, scope: context)
      changeset
    end)
    |> Ash.Changeset.before_action(fn changeset ->
      # Runs inside the transaction before the main action
      # Use for related database changes in the same transaction
      Ash.Changeset.change_attribute(changeset, :processed_at, DateTime.utc_now())
    end)
    |> Ash.Changeset.after_action(fn changeset, result ->
      # Runs inside the transaction after the main action, only on success
      # Use for related database changes that depend on the result
      MyApp.Inventory.update_stock_levels(result, scope: context)
      {changeset, result}
    end)
    |> Ash.Changeset.after_transaction(fn changeset,
      {:ok, result} ->
        # Runs after the transaction completes (success or failure)
        # Use for notifications, external systems, etc.
        MyApp.Mailer.send_order_confirmation(result, scope: context)
        {changeset, result}

      {:error, error} ->
        # Runs after the transaction completes (success or failure)
        # Use for notifications, external systems, etc.
        MyApp.Mailer.send_order_issue_notice(result, scope: context)
        {:error, error}
    end)
  end
end

# Usage in resource:
change {MyApp.Changes.ProcessOrder, []}
```

## Custom Modules vs. Anonymous Functions

Prefer to put code in its own module and refer to that in changes, preparations, validations etc.

For example, prefer this:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.MyDomain.MyResource.Changes.SlugifyName do
  use Ash.Resource.Change

  def change(changeset, _, _) do
    Ash.Changeset.before_action(changeset, fn changeset, _ ->
      slug = MyApp.Slug.get()
      Ash.Changeset.force_change_attribute(changeset, :slug, slug)
    end)
  end
end

change MyApp.MyDomain.MyResource.Changes.SlugifyName
```

### Action Types

- **Read**: For retrieving records
- **Create**: For creating records
- **Update**: For changing records
- **Destroy**: For removing records
- **Generic**: For custom operations that don't fit the other types

## Relationships

Relationships describe connections between resources and are a core component of Ash. Define relationships in the `relationships` block of a resource.

### Best Practices for Relationships

- Be descriptive with relationship names (e.g., use `:authored_posts` instead of just `:posts`)
- Configure foreign key constraints in your data layer if they have them (see `references` in AshPostgres)
- Always choose the appropriate relationship type based on your domain model

#### Relationship Types

- For Polymorphic relationships, you can model them using `Ash.Type.Union`; see the “Polymorphic Relationships” guide for more information.

```elixir
relationships do
  # belongs_to - adds foreign key to source resource
  belongs_to :owner, MyApp.User do
    allow_nil? false
    attribute_type :integer  # defaults to :uuid
  end

  # has_one - foreign key on destination resource
  has_one :profile, MyApp.Profile

  # has_many - foreign key on destination resource, returns list
  has_many :posts, MyApp.Post do
    filter expr(published == true)
    sort published_at: :desc
  end

  # many_to_many - requires join resource
  many_to_many :tags, MyApp.Tag do
    through MyApp.PostTag
    source_attribute_on_join_resource :post_id
    destination_attribute_on_join_resource :tag_id
  end
end
```

The join resource must be defined separately:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.PostTag do
  use Ash.Resource,
    data_layer: AshPostgres.DataLayer

  attributes do
    uuid_primary_key :id
    # Add additional attributes if you need metadata on the relationship
    attribute :added_at, :utc_datetime_usec do
      default &DateTime.utc_now/0
    end
  end

  relationships do
    belongs_to :post, MyApp.Post, primary_key?: true, allow_nil?: false
    belongs_to :tag, MyApp.Tag, primary_key?: true, allow_nil?: false
  end

  actions do
    defaults [:read, :destroy, create: :*, update: :*]
  end
end
```

### Loading Relationships

```elixir
# Using code interface options (preferred)
post = MyDomain.get_post!(id, load: [:author, comments: [:author]])

# Complex loading with filters
posts = MyDomain.list_posts!(
  query: [load: [comments: [filter: [is_approved: true], limit: 5]]]
)

# Manual query building (for complex cases)
MyApp.Post
|> Ash.Query.load(comments: MyApp.Comment |> Ash.Query.filter(is_approved == true))
|> Ash.read!()

# Loading on existing records
Ash.load!(post, :author)
```

Prefer to use the `strict?` option when loading to only load necessary fields on related data.

```elixir
MyApp.Post
|> Ash.Query.load([comments: [:title]], strict?: true)
```

### Managing Relationships

There are two primary ways to manage relationships in Ash:

#### 1. Using `change manage_relationship/2-3` in Actions
Use this when input comes from action arguments:

```elixir
actions do
  update :update do
    # Define argument for the related data
    argument :comments, {:array, :map} do
      allow_nil? false
    end

    argument :new_tags, {:array, :map}

    # Link argument to relationship management
    change manage_relationship(:comments, type: :append)

    # For different argument and relationship names
    change manage_relationship(:new_tags, :tags, type: :append)
  end
end
```

#### 2. Using `Ash.Changeset.manage_relationship/3-4` in Custom Changes
Use this when building values programmatically:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Changes.AssignTeamMembers do
  use Ash.Resource.Change

  def change(changeset, _opts, context) do
    members = determine_team_members(changeset, context.actor)

    Ash.Changeset.manage_relationship(
      changeset,
      :members,
      members,
      type: :append_and_remove
    )
  end
end
```

#### Quick Reference - Management Types
- `:append` - Add new related records, ignore existing
- `:append_and_remove` - Add new related records, remove missing
- `:remove` - Remove specified related records
- `:direct_control` - Full CRUD control (create/update/destroy)
- `:create` - Only create new records

#### Quick Reference - Common Options
- `on_lookup: :relate` - Look up and relate existing records
- `on_no_match: :create` - Create if no match found
- `on_match: :update` - Update existing matches
- `on_missing: :destroy` - Delete records not in input
- `value_is_key: :name` - Use field as key for simple values

For comprehensive documentation, see the [Managing Relationships](https://hexdocs.pm/ash/relationships.html#managing-relationships) section.

#### Examples

Creating a post with tags:
```elixir
MyDomain.create_post!(%{
  title: "New Post",
  body: "Content here...",
  tags: [%{name: "elixir"}, %{name: "ash"}]  # Creates new tags
})

# Updating a post to replace its tags
MyDomain.update_post!(post, %{
  tags: [tag1.id, tag2.id]  # Replaces tags with existing ones by ID
})
```

## Generating Code

Use `mix ash.gen.*` tasks as a basis for code generation when possible. Check the task docs with `mix help <task>`.
Be sure to use `--yes` to bypass confirmation prompts. Use `--yes --dry-run` to preview the changes.

## Data Layers

Data layers determine how resources are stored and retrieved. Examples of data layers:

- **Postgres**: For storing resources in PostgreSQL (via `AshPostgres`)
- **ETS**: For in-memory storage (`Ash.DataLayer.Ets`)
- **Mnesia**: For distributed storage (`Ash.DataLayer.Mnesia`)
- **Embedded**: For resources embedded in other resources (`data_layer: :embedded`) (typically JSON under the hood)
- **Ash.DataLayer.Simple**: For resources that aren't persisted at all. Leave off the data layer, as this is the default.

Specify a data layer when defining a resource:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Post do
  use Ash.Resource,
    domain: MyApp.Blog,
    data_layer: AshPostgres.DataLayer

  postgres do
    table "posts"
    repo MyApp.Repo
  end

  # ... attributes, relationships, etc.
end
```

For embedded resources:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Address do
  use Ash.Resource,
    data_layer: :embedded

  attributes do
    attribute :street, :string
    attribute :city, :string
    attribute :state, :string
    attribute :zip, :string
  end
end
```

Each data layer has its own configuration options and capabilities. Refer to the rules & documentation of the specific data layer package for more details.

## Migrations and Schema Changes

After creating or modifying Ash code, run `mix ash.codegen <short_name_describing_changes>` to ensure any required additional changes are made (like migrations are generated). The name of the migration should be lower_snake_case. In a longer running dev session it's usually better to use `mix ash.codegen --dev` as you go and at the end run the final codegen with a sensible name describing all the changes made in the session.

## Authorization

- When performing administrative actions, you can bypass authorization with `authorize?: false`
- To run actions as a particular user, look that user up and pass it as the `actor` option
- Always set the actor on the query/changeset/input, not when calling the action
- Use policies to define authorization rules

```elixir
# Good
Post
|> Ash.Query.for_read(:read, %{}, actor: current_user)
|> Ash.read!()

# BAD, DO NOT DO THIS
Post
|> Ash.Query.for_read(:read, %{})
|> Ash.read!(actor: current_user)
```

### Policies

To use policies, add the `Ash.Policy.Authorizer` to your resource:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Post do
  use Ash.Resource,
    domain: MyApp.Blog,
    authorizers: [Ash.Policy.Authorizer]

  # Rest of resource definition...
end
```

### Policy Basics

Policies determine what actions on a resource are permitted for a given actor. Define policies in the `policies` block:

```elixir
policies do
  # A simple policy that applies to all read actions
  policy action_type(:read) do
    # Authorize if record is public
    authorize_if expr(public == true)

    # Authorize if actor is the owner
    authorize_if relates_to_actor_via(:owner)
  end

  # A policy for create actions
  policy action_type(:create) do
    # Only allow active users to create records
    forbid_unless actor_attribute_equals(:active, true)

    # Ensure the record being created relates to the actor
    authorize_if relating_to_actor(:owner)
  end
end
```

### Policy Evaluation Flow

Policies evaluate from top to bottom with the following logic:

1. All policies that apply to an action must pass for the action to be allowed
2. Within each policy, checks evaluate from top to bottom
3. The first check that produces a decision determines the policy result
4. If no check produces a decision, the policy defaults to forbidden

### IMPORTANT: Policy Check Logic

**the first check that yields a result determines the policy outcome**

```elixir
# WRONG - This is OR logic, not AND logic!
policy action_type(:update) do
  authorize_if actor_attribute_equals(:admin?, true)    # If this passes, policy passes
  authorize_if relates_to_actor_via(:owner)           # Only checked if first fails
end
```

To require BOTH conditions in that example, you would use `forbid_unless` for the first condition:

```elixir
# CORRECT - This requires BOTH conditions
policy action_type(:update) do
  forbid_unless actor_attribute_equals(:admin?, true)  # Must be admin
  authorize_if relates_to_actor_via(:owner)           # AND must be owner
end
```

Alternative patterns for AND logic:
- Use multiple separate policies (each must pass independently)
- Use a single complex expression with `expr(condition1 and condition2)`
- Use `forbid_unless` for required conditions, then `authorize_if` for the final check

### Bypass Policies

Use bypass policies to allow certain actors to bypass other policy restrictions. This should be used almost exclusively for admin bypasses.

```elixir
policies do
  # Bypass policy for admins - if this passes, other policies don't need to pass
  bypass actor_attribute_equals(:admin, true) do
    authorize_if always()
  end

  # Regular policies follow...
  policy action_type(:read) do
    # ...
  end
end
```

### Field Policies

Field policies control access to specific fields (attributes, calculations, aggregates):

```elixir
field_policies do
  # Only supervisors can see the salary field
  field_policy :salary do
    authorize_if actor_attribute_equals(:role, :supervisor)
  end

  # Allow access to all other fields
  field_policy :* do
    authorize_if always()
  end
end
```

### Policy Checks

There are two main types of checks used in policies:

1. **Simple checks** - Return true/false answers (e.g., "is the actor an admin?")
2. **Filter checks** - Return filters to apply to data (e.g., "only show records owned by the actor")

You can use built-in checks or create custom ones:

```elixir
# Built-in checks
authorize_if actor_attribute_equals(:role, :admin)
authorize_if relates_to_actor_via(:owner)
authorize_if expr(public == true)

# Custom check module
authorize_if MyApp.Checks.ActorHasPermission
```

#### Custom Policy Checks

Create custom checks by implementing `Ash.Policy.SimpleCheck` or `Ash.Policy.FilterCheck`:

```elixir
# Simple check - returns true/false
defmodule MyApp.Checks.ActorHasRole do
  use Ash.Policy.SimpleCheck

  def match?(%{role: actor_role}, _context, opts) do
    actor_role == (opts[:role] || :admin)
  end
  def match?(_, _, _), do: false
end

# Filter check - returns query filter
defmodule MyApp.Checks.VisibleToUserLevel do
  use Ash.Policy.FilterCheck

  def filter(actor, _authorizer, _opts) do
    expr(visibility_level <= ^actor.user_level)
  end
end

# Usage
policy action_type(:read) do
  authorize_if {MyApp.Checks.ActorHasRole, role: :manager}
  authorize_if MyApp.Checks.VisibleToUserLevel
end
```

## Calculations

Calculations allow you to define derived values based on a resource's attributes or related data. Define calculations in the `calculations` block of a resource:

```elixir
calculations do
  # Simple expression calculation
  calculate :full_name, :string, expr(first_name <> " " <> last_name)

  # Expression with conditions
  calculate :status_label, :string, expr(
    cond do
      status == :active -> "Active"
      status == :pending -> "Pending Review"
      true -> "Inactive"
    end
  )

  # Using module calculations for more complex logic
  calculate :risk_score, :integer, {MyApp.Calculations.RiskScore, min: 0, max: 100}
end
```

### Expression Calculations

Expression calculations use Ash expressions and can be pushed down to the data layer when possible:

```elixir
calculations do
  # Simple string concatenation
  calculate :full_name, :string, expr(first_name <> " " <> last_name)

  # Math operations
  calculate :total_with_tax, :decimal, expr(amount * (1 + tax_rate))

  # Date manipulation
  calculate :days_since_created, :integer, expr(
    date_diff(^now(), inserted_at, :day)
  )
end
```

### Expressions

In order to use expressions outside of resources, changes, preparations etc. you will need to use `Ash.Expr`.

It provides both `expr/1` and template helpers like `actor/1` and `arg/1`.

For example:

```elixir
import Ash.Expr

Author
|> Ash.Query.aggregate(:count_of_my_favorited_posts, :count, [:posts], query: [
  filter: expr(favorited_by(user_id: ^actor(:id)))
])
```

See the expressions guide for more information on what is available in expresisons and
how to use them.

### Module Calculations

For complex calculations, create a module that implements `Ash.Resource.Calculation`:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Calculations.FullName do
  use Ash.Resource.Calculation

  # Validate and transform options
  @impl true
  def init(opts) do
    {:ok, Map.put_new(opts, :separator, " ")}
  end

  # Specify what data needs to be loaded
  @impl true
  def load(_query, _opts, _context) do
    [:first_name, :last_name]
  end

  # Implement the calculation logic
  @impl true
  def calculate(records, opts, _context) do
    Enum.map(records, fn record ->
      [record.first_name, record.last_name]
      |> Enum.reject(&is_nil/1)
      |> Enum.join(opts.separator)
    end)
  end
end

# Usage in a resource
calculations do
  calculate :full_name, :string, {MyApp.Calculations.FullName, separator: ", "}
end
```

### Calculations with Arguments

You can define calculations that accept arguments:

```elixir
calculations do
  calculate :full_name, :string, expr(first_name <> ^arg(:separator) <> last_name) do
    argument :separator, :string do
      allow_nil? false
      default " "
      constraints [allow_empty?: true, trim?: false]
    end
  end
end
```

### Using Calculations

```elixir
# Using code interface options (preferred)
users = MyDomain.list_users!(load: [full_name: [separator: ", "]])

# Filtering and sorting
users = MyDomain.list_users!(
  query: [
    filter: [full_name: [separator: " ", value: "John Doe"]],
    sort: [full_name: {[separator: " "], :asc}]
  ]
)

# Manual query building (for complex cases)
User |> Ash.Query.load(full_name: [separator: ", "]) |> Ash.read!()

# Loading on existing records
Ash.load!(users, :full_name)
```

### Code Interface for Calculations

Define calculation functions on your domain for standalone use:

```elixir
# In your domain
resource User do
  define_calculation :full_name, args: [:first_name, :last_name, {:optional, :separator}]
end

# Then call it directly
MyDomain.full_name("John", "Doe", ", ")  # Returns "John, Doe"
```

## Aggregates

Aggregates allow you to retrieve summary information over groups of related data, like counts, sums, or averages. Define aggregates in the `aggregates` block of a resource.

Aggregates can work over relationships or directly over unrelated resources:

```elixir
aggregates do
  # Related aggregates - use relationship path
  count :published_post_count, :posts do
    filter expr(published == true)
  end

  sum :total_sales, :orders, :amount

  exists :is_admin, :roles do
    filter expr(name == "admin")
  end

  # Unrelated aggregates - use resource module directly
  count :matching_profiles_count, Profile do
    filter expr(name == parent(name))
  end
  
  sum :total_report_score, Report, :score do
    filter expr(author_name == parent(name))
  end
  
  exists :has_reports, Report do
    filter expr(author_name == parent(name))
  end
end
```

For unrelated aggregates, use `parent/1` to reference fields from the source resource.

### Aggregate Types

- **count**: Counts related items meeting criteria
- **sum**: Sums a field across related items
- **exists**: Returns boolean indicating if matching related items exist (also supports unrelated resources)
- **first**: Gets the first related value matching criteria
- **list**: Lists the related values for a specific field
- **max**: Gets the maximum value of a field
- **min**: Gets the minimum value of a field
- **avg**: Gets the average value of a field

### Using Aggregates

```elixir
# Using code interface options (preferred)
users = MyDomain.list_users!(
  load: [:published_post_count, :total_sales],
  query: [
    filter: [published_post_count: [greater_than: 5]],
    sort: [published_post_count: :desc]
  ]
)

# Manual query building (for complex cases)
User |> Ash.Query.filter(published_post_count > 5) |> Ash.read!()

# Loading on existing records
Ash.load!(users, :published_post_count)
```

### Join Filters

For complex aggregates involving multiple relationships, use join filters:

```elixir
aggregates do
  sum :redeemed_deal_amount, [:redeems, :deal], :amount do
    # Filter on the aggregate as a whole
    filter expr(redeems.redeemed == true)

    # Apply filters to specific relationship steps
    join_filter :redeems, expr(redeemed == true)
    join_filter [:redeems, :deal], expr(active == parent(require_active))
  end
end
```

### Inline Aggregates

Use aggregates inline within expressions:

```elixir
# Related inline aggregates
calculate :grade_percentage, :decimal, expr(
  count(answers, query: [filter: expr(correct == true)]) * 100 /
  count(answers)
)

# Unrelated inline aggregates
calculate :profile_count, :integer, expr(
  count(Profile, filter: expr(name == parent(name)))
)

calculate :stats, :map, expr(%{
  profiles: count(Profile, filter: expr(active == true)),
  reports: count(Report, filter: expr(author_name == parent(name))),
  has_active_profile: exists(Profile, active == true and name == parent(name))
})
```

## Exists Expressions

Use `exists/2` to check for the existence of records, either through relationships or unrelated resources:

### Related Exists

```elixir
# Check if user has any admin roles
Ash.Query.filter(User, exists(roles, name == "admin"))

# Check if post has comments with high scores
Ash.Query.filter(Post, exists(comments, score > 50))
```

### Unrelated Exists

```elixir
# Check if any profile exists with the same name
Ash.Query.filter(User, exists(Profile, name == parent(name)))

# Check if user has any reports
Ash.Query.filter(User, exists(Report, author_name == parent(name)))

# Complex existence checks
Ash.Query.filter(User, 
  active == true and 
  exists(Profile, active == true and name == parent(name))
)
```

Unrelated exists expressions automatically apply authorization using the target resource's primary read action. Use `parent/1` to reference fields from the source resource.

## Testing

When testing resources:
- Test your domain actions through the code interface
- Use test utilities in `Ash.Test`
- Test authorization policies work as expected using `Ash.can?`
- Use `authorize?: false` in tests where authorization is not the focus
- Write generators using `Ash.Generator`
- Prefer to use raising versions of functions whenever possible, as opposed to pattern matching

### Preventing Deadlocks in Concurrent Tests

When running tests concurrently, using fixed values for identity attributes can cause deadlock errors. Multiple tests attempting to create records with the same unique values will conflict.

#### Use Globally Unique Values

Always use globally unique values for identity attributes in tests:

```elixir
# BAD - Can cause deadlocks in concurrent tests
%{email: "test@example.com", username: "testuser"}

# GOOD - Use globally unique values
%{
  email: "test-#{System.unique_integer([:positive])}@example.com",
  username: "user_#{System.unique_integer([:positive])}",
  slug: "post-#{System.unique_integer([:positive])}"
}
```

#### Creating Reusable Test Generators

For better organization, create a generator module:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.TestGenerators do
  use Ash.Generator

  def user(opts \\ []) do
    changeset_generator(
      User,
      :create,
      defaults: [
        email: "user-#{System.unique_integer([:positive])}@example.com",
        username: "user_#{System.unique_integer([:positive])}"
      ],
      overrides: opts
    )
  end
end

# In your tests
test "concurrent user creation" do
  users = MyApp.TestGenerators.generate_many(user(), 10)
  # Each user has unique identity attributes
end
```

This applies to ANY field used in identity constraints, not just primary keys. Using globally unique values prevents frustrating intermittent test failures in CI environments.
