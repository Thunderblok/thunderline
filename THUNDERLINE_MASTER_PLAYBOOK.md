## 🌿 SYSTEMS THEORY OPERATING FRAME (PLAYBOOK AUGMENT)

This Playbook is now bound by the ecological governance rules (see OKO Handbook & Domain Catalog augmentations). Each phase must prove *systemic balance* not just feature completeness.

Phase Acceptance Criteria now includes:
1. Domain Impact Matrix delta reviewed (no predation / mutation drift)
2. Event Taxonomy adherence (no ad-hoc event shape divergence)
3. Balance Metrics trend acceptable (no > threshold excursions newly introduced)
4. Steward sign-offs captured in PR references
5. Catalog synchronization executed (resource + relationship updates) 

Balance Review Gate (BRG) is inserted at end of every major sprint; failing BRG triggers a `stability_sprint` (hardening, no net new features).

BRG Checklist (automatable future task):
- [ ] `warning.count` below threshold or trending downward
- [ ] No unauthorized Interaction Matrix edges
- [ ] Reactor retry & undo rates within SLO
- [ ] Event fanout distribution healthy (no new heavy tail outliers)
- [ ] Resource growth per domain within expected sprint envelope

## **🎯 CONCLUSION: We're In Perfect Sync!**

**Your vision is SPOT ON**, bro! The architecture you outlined is exactly what we need:

1. **ThunderBlock** → User onboarding & server provisioning ✅
2. **ThunderCrown** → AI governance & MCP integration 🔄
3. **ThunderBolt** → Orchestration & sub-agent deployment 🔄
4. **ThunderFlow** → Intelligent task routing ✅
5. **ThunderLink** → Communication & automation execution ✅ (Discord-style nav + auth online)

The foundation is **SOLID** - we've got the engine running clean, state machines working, and the core optimization algorithms ready. Now we need to build the experience layer that makes it all accessible to users.

**First milestone: Send an email** is PERFECT. It touches every part of the system without being overwhelming, and it's something users immediately understand and value.

Secondary near-term milestone: **Realtime authenticated presence + AshAI panel activation** to convert static chat surface into intelligent collaborative environment.

## ♻ CONTINUOUS BALANCE OPERATIONS (CBO)

Recurring weekly tasks:
1. Catalog Diff Scan → detect resource churn anomalies.
2. Event Schema Drift Audit → confirm version bumps recorded.
3. Reactor Failure Cohort Analysis → top 3 transient causes & mitigation PRs.
4. Queue Depth Trend Review → adjust concurrency/partitioning if P95 rising.
5. Steward Sync → 15m standup: edges added, invariants changed, upcoming DIP proposals.

Quarterly resilience game day:
- Simulate domain outage (Flow or Gate) → measure recovery time & compensation.
- Inject elevated retry errors → verify backpressure and no cascading fanout.
- Randomly quarantine a Reactor → ensure degraded mode still meets SLO subset.

Artifacts to archive after each game day: metrics diff, incident timeline, remediation backlog.
