### Ground Truth Verification Summary (November 18, 2025)

**Context**: External High Command review (Aug 25, 2025) contained inaccuracies. This summary reflects **verified ground truth** from direct codebase access.

**Critical Findings**:

1. **ThunderCom Consolidation - RESOLVED (Nov 18 2025)** ✅
   - **HC Review Claim**: "0 resources, fully deprecated, safe to remove"
   - **Ground Truth (Nov 17)**: 8 active resources, LiveViews + seeds still depended on ThunderCom
   - **Action**: Executed HC-27 migration plan (8 phases) culminating in full removal of `lib/thunderline/thundercom/`, LiveViews pointing to ThunderLink, duplicate seed/voice helpers deleted, and all compilation/tests passing
   - **Result**: Single communications domain (ThunderLink) with preserved DB tables; consolidation backlog item closed

2. **Resource Duplication - RESOLVED (Nov 18 2025)** ✅
   - **Issue (Nov 17)**: Community, Channel, Message, Role, FederationSocket implemented in both domains with namespace drift (VoiceRoom vs Voice.Room)
   - **Action**: Compared implementations, selected ThunderLink as canonical, removed ThunderCom duplicates, aligned namespace, reran compile/tests
   - **Result**: Zero duplicate Ash resources; HC-28 closed with supporting documentation

3. **ThunderVine Architecture Decision IMPLEMENTED** ✅
   - **Original Finding**: ThunderVine logic operated without a domain boundary while owning DAG resources
   - **Action**: Created ThunderVine.Domain (HC-29) with Workflow/Node/Edge/Snapshot resources migrated from ThunderBlock without schema changes
   - **Result**: Clear ownership, policy enforcement surface, API exposure ready

4. **ThunderChief Deprecation - CORRECT** ✅
   - **HC Review Claim**: "Deprecated, merged into ThunderCrown"
   - **Ground Truth**: CONFIRMED - No domain.ex file exists
   - **Status**: Only utility modules remain, domain successfully removed

5. **ThunderForge Placeholder - CORRECT** ✅
   - **HC Review Claim**: "Empty placeholder, 3 stub files"
   - **Ground Truth**: CONFIRMED - domain.ex with empty resources block
   - **Recommendation**: Remove for MVP (unless implementation planned)
   - **New P0 Item**: HC-30 (cleanup decision)

**Updated Resource Counts**:
- Total Active Domains: 8 (ThunderCom removed Nov 18 2025)
- Total Resources: ~160 (ThunderLink absorbed 8 migrated resources)
- ThunderLink: 17 resources (single canonical implementation)
- ThunderCom: 0 active resources (directory removed; history preserved in git)

**Consolidation Status Updates**:

- ⚠️ In Progress: 2 consolidations (ThunderJam→Gate, ThunderClock→Block)

**P0 Backlog Impact**:
- HC-27 and HC-28 marked **Done** (Nov 18 2025); HC-29 and HC-30 already complete; HC-26 now tracks the remaining two consolidations only
- Estimated Effort Remaining: ThunderJam (2-3 days), ThunderClock (1-2 days)

**Documentation Updated**:
- ✅ DOMAIN_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md - Consolidation log appended with HC-27/28 completion notes
- ✅ THUNDERLINE_DOMAIN_CATALOG.md - ThunderCom section moved to "Removed"; ThunderLink counts refreshed
- ✅ thunderline_domain_resource_guide.md - Resource counts updated; duplicates removed from diagrams
- ✅ THUNDERLINE_MASTER_PLAYBOOK.md - This document now tracks HC-27/28 closure

## 🛰 WARHORSE Week 1 Delta (Aug 31 2025)

Status snapshot of architecture hardening & migration tasks executed under WARHORSE stewardship since Aug 28.

Implemented:
- Blackboard Migration: `Thunderline.Thunderflow.Blackboard` now the supervised canonical implementation (legacy `Thunderbolt.Automata.Blackboard` deprecated delegator only). Telemetry added for `:put` and `:fetch` with hit/miss outcomes.
- Event Validation Guardrail: `Thunderline.Thunderflow.EventValidator` integrated into `EventBus` routing path with environment‑mode behavior (dev warn / test raise / prod drop & audit).
- Heartbeat Unification: Single `:system_tick` emitter (`Thunderline.Thunderflow.Heartbeat`) at 2s interval.
- Event Taxonomy Linter Task: `mix thunderline.events.lint` implemented (registry/category/AI whitelist rules) – CI wiring pending.
- Legacy Mix Task Cleanup: Removed duplicate stub causing module redefinition.

Adjusted Docs / Doctrine:
- HC-01 moved to In Progress (publish helper exists; needs telemetry span enrichment & CI gating of linter to call it “Done”).
- Guardrails table (Handbook) updated: Blackboard migration complete.

Emerging Blindspots / Gaps (Actionable):
1. EventBus `publish_event/1` Overloads: Three clauses accept differing maps (`data`, `payload`, generic). Consider normalizing constructor path & returning error (not silent :ok) when validation fails; currently `route_event/2` swallows validator errors returning `{:ok, ev}`.
2. Flow → DB Direct Reads: `Thunderline.Thunderflow.Telemetry.ObanDiagnostics` queries Repo (domain doctrine says Flow should not perform direct DB access). Mitigation: Move diagnostics querying under Block or introduce a minimal `Thunderline.Thunderblock.ObanIntrospection` boundary.
3. Residual Bus Shim: `Thunderline.Application` still invokes `Thunderline.Bus.init_tables()` task. Codemod & deprecation telemetry for HC‑02 still pending.
4. Link Domain Policy Surface: Ash resource declarations in Link use `Ash.Policy.Authorizer` (expected) but require audit to ensure no embedded policy logic (conditions) that belong in Crown. Add Credo check `NoPolicyLogicInLink` (planned).
5. Event Naming Consistency: Cross‑domain & realtime naming sometimes produce `system.<source>.<type>` while other helper code passes explicit `event_name`. Need taxonomy enforcement for reserved prefixes (`ui.`, `ai.`, `system.`) – extend linter (HC‑03).
6. Blackboard Migration Metric: Add gauge/counter for deprecated module calls (currently delegator silent) to track drift → 0 (target end Week 2). Tripwire could reflect count.
7. Validator Strictness Drift: In production path we “return ok” after drops. Provide optional strict mode flag for canary to raise on invalid events during staging.
8. Repo Isolation Escalation: Currently advisory Credo check only; define allowlist & fail mode ahead of Week 3 (per doctrine).

Planned Immediate Next (WARHORSE Week 1 Remainder / Kickoff Week 2):
- Integrate `mix thunderline.events.lint` into CI (fail build on errors) & add JSON output parsing in pipeline.
- Implement Bus shim deprecation telemetry: emit `[:thunderline,:bus,:shim_use]` per call site during codemod window.
- Add `Blackboard` legacy usage counter & LiveDashboard metric panel section.
- Refactor EventBus publish path to single constructor & explicit validator error return tuple.
- Draft Credo checks: `NoPolicyLogicInLink`, `NoRepoOutsideBlock` (escalation flag), `NoLegacyBusAlias`.

Success Metrics (Week 2 Targets):
- legacy.blackboard.calls == 0 for 24h
- bus.shim.use rate trending downward to zero
- event.taxonomy.lint.errors == 0 in main for 3 consecutive days
- repo.out_of_block.violations == 0 (warning mode)

## 🤖 Cerebros NAS Integration Snapshot (Sep 2025)

Status summary for the ThunderBolt ML ledger, Cerebros bridge boundary, and NAS orchestration.

**Bridge & Feature Flag**
- `Thunderline.Thunderbolt.CerebrosBridge.Client` guards execution with `features.ml_nas` and runtime config (`config :thunderline, :cerebros_bridge`).
- Translator + Invoker pair (`translator.ex`, `invoker.ex`) marshal contracts to Python subprocesses with retries, exponential backoff, and structured `%Thunderline.Thunderflow.ErrorClass{}` errors.
- ETS-backed cache (`cache.ex`) provides optional response memoization; telemetry emitted under `[:cerebros, :bridge, :cache, *]`.

**Contracts & Canonical Events**
- Versioned contracts (`Contracts.RunStartedV1`, `TrialReportedV1`, `RunFinalizedV1`) describe lifecycle payloads.
- Client publishes canonical Thunderflow events `ml.run.start|stop|exception` and `ml.run.trial` through `Thunderline.Thunderflow.EventBus` with normalized metadata.

**Ash Resources & Ledger**
- `Thunderline.Thunderbolt.Resources.ModelRun` + `ModelArtifact` persist NAS pulses and produced artifacts.
- ML registry namespace (`lib/thunderline/thunderbolt/ml/`) stores specs, versions, datasets, Axon trainer metadata, and consent records.
- Adapter & artifact helpers (`cerebros/adapter.ex`, `cerebros/artifacts.ex`) hydrate bridge responses into Ash actions and ensure artifact persistence.

**Outstanding Gaps / Actions**
1. HC-04: Run pending migrations + wire lifecycle state machine on `ModelRun` (current status: In Progress).
2. HC-20: Author bridge boundary doc + DIP, publish configuration recipe, and surface cache/telemetry tuning guidance.
3. Flower control plane now consumes the Keras backend (`python/cerebros/keras/flower_app.py`) removing the PyTorch dependency; ensure SuperExec images embed the module and publish CPU baseline values for Ops.
4. Implement resilient search/exploration strategy (replace `simple_search.ex` stub) and feed outcomes back into trials queue.
4. Publish walkthrough for executing NAS loop via Thunderhelm (Livebook → Cerebros runner → MLflow) including feature flag prerequisites.
5. Add `mix thunderline.ml.validate` (planned) to verify bridge config, dataset availability, and event emission paths before enabling flag.

## 🌩️ Thundra & Nerves Integration (HC-23 High Command Directive)

**Strategic Context**: Multi-dimensional PAC execution engine enabling sovereign agents to run seamlessly in **cloud** (Thundra VM) or on **edge devices** (Nerves hardware runtime) with unified policy enforcement. This establishes Thunderline's differentiated capability: PACs that can autonomously execute complex workflows across distributed infrastructure with full lineage tracking and governance.

### 🎯 Executive Summary

**Thundra VM** is a tick-driven voxelized cellular automata engine hosted in ThunderBolt that provides PAC agents with:
- Time-state evolution through 12-zone hexagonal lattice (chakra-inspired progression)
- Hierarchical agent architecture (Thunderbit → Thunderbolt → Sage → Magus → Thunderchief)
- ~3 million atomic state cells per Thunderblock instance
- GraphQL-queryable live state via ThunderGrid
- Full event DAG lineage tracking (correlation_id/causation_id chains)

**Nerves Runtime** enables PACs to execute on physical devices (Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, etc.) with:
- Signed firmware with embedded client certificates
- mTLS enrollment via ThunderGate
- Local autonomous control loops with cloud fallback
- Cached Crown policy manifests for offline governance
- Telemetry backhaul through ThunderLink TOCP transport
- OTA updates orchestrated by ThunderGate

### 🏗️ Architecture Foundations

#### Domain Boundary Assignments

| Domain | Thundra Responsibilities | Nerves Responsibilities |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------|

#### Thundra VM Architecture

**Core Design Principles:**
- **Voxelized Time-State**: 3D cellular automata with honeycomb structure enabling parallel state evolution
- **12-Zone Hexagonal Lattice**: Inspired by chakra progression model, zones cycle through states providing temporal rhythm
- **Tick-Tock Cycles**: Fast micro-updates (tick) + slow macro-sync (tock, every 7 ticks) for balance between responsiveness and stability
- **Event-Driven**: Every state transition emits `thundra.*` events with full lineage (correlation_id/causation_id chains)

**Zone Configuration** (12 zones per Thunderblock):

| Zone | Chakra Mapping | Active Time | Full Cycle | Primary Function |
|------|----------------|-------------|------------|------------------|
| 1 | Red/Root | ~12s | ~132s | Memory/Persistence (Thundervault integration) |
| 2 | Orange/Sacral | ~12s | ~132s | Security/Access (Thundergate validation) |
| 3 | Yellow/Solar | ~12s | ~132s | Computation (Thunderbolt/Lit workload) |
| 4 | Green/Heart | ~12s | ~132s | API/Interchange (Thundergrid queries) |
| 5 | Blue/Throat | ~12s | ~132s | Communication (ThunderLink messaging) |
| 6 | Indigo/Third Eye | ~12s | ~132s | Monitoring (ThunderEye observability) |
| 7 | Violet/Crown | ~12s | ~132s | Governance (ThunderCrown policy) |
| 8-12 | Extended | ~12s | ~132s | Future expansion (reserved) |

**Hierarchical Agent Structure:**

```
Thunderblock Instance
├── 12 Zones (chakra-inspired)
│   ├── 1 Thunderchief (zone leader)
│   ├── 3 Magi (load balancers, 1 per cluster)
│   ├── 12 Sages (workers, 1 per sector)
│   │   └── 144 Thunderbolts (functional clusters per Sage)
│   │       └── 144 Thunderbits (atomic cells per Thunderbolt)
│
└── Scale: ~3 million Thunderbits total
    - 1,728 Thunderbolts per zone (12 Sages × 144 Thunderbolts)
    - 20,736 Thunderbolts per Thunderblock (12 zones × 1,728)
    - ~3M Thunderbits (20,736 Thunderbolts × 144 Thunderbits)
```

**Agent Responsibilities:**
- **Thunderbit**: Atomic state cell (smallest unit of computation)
- **Thunderbolt**: 144 Thunderbits forming functional cluster (local coordination)
- **Sage**: Worker controlling 144 Thunderbolts (sector management, resource allocation)
- **Magus**: Load balancer coordinating 4 Sages (cluster coordination, failover)
- **Thunderchief**: Zone leader (1 per zone, cross-zone coordination with other Chiefs)

**Tick-Tock Execution Model:**
```elixir
# Tick Cycle (Fast - Micro Updates)
- Thunderbit state transitions (local rules)
- Thunderbolt aggregation (cluster consensus)
- Sage coordination (sector sync)
- Event emission: thundra.tick.{zone_id}

# Tock Cycle (Slow - Macro Sync, every 7 ticks)
- Magus load balancing (redistribute work)
- Thunderchief zone sync (cross-zone coordination)
- State persistence to ThunderBlock
- Event emission: thundra.tock.{zone_id}

# Full Zone Rotation: ~132 seconds
# (12 zones × ~12 seconds active per zone = ~144s theoretical)
# (Actual ~132s accounting for transition overhead)
```

**GraphQL Integration (ThunderGrid):**
- Live PAC state queryable via `query { pacs { thundraState { zone currentTick voxelData } } }`
- Subscriptions for tick/tock events: `subscription { thundraTick(zoneId: 3) { timestamp agents } }`
- Zone health metrics: `query { thundraZones { id activeAgents tickRate latency } }`

**Event DAG Lineage:**
```elixir
# Every Thundra state transition emits event with lineage
%Thunderline.Event{
  name: "thundra.tick.zone_3",
  source: :bolt,
  payload: %{
    zone_id: 3,
    tick_count: 42,
    active_agents: 1728,
    state_mutations: [...]
  },
  correlation_id: "pac-123-session-abc",  # Links entire PAC session
  causation_id: "thundra.tick.zone_3.41", # Previous tick that caused this one
  event_hash: "sha256...",                 # Ledger integrity
  event_signature: "ecdsa..."              # Crown cryptographic proof
}
```

#### Nerves Hardware Runtime

**Deployment Pipeline:**
1. **Firmware Build**: `mix firmware` → signed `.fw` image with embedded client cert
2. **Device Provisioning**: Flash firmware to device (SD card or network)
3. **First Boot**: Device presents cert to ThunderGate for mTLS handshake
4. **Enrollment**: ThunderGate validates cert → ThunderLink establishes session → device registered in ThunderBlock
5. **Policy Download**: Device fetches Crown policy manifest (cached locally)
6. **PAC Initialization**: Device spawns local PAC runtime with cached policies
7. **Telemetry Start**: Device begins backhaul via ThunderLink TOCP transport

**mTLS Enrollment Flow:**
```elixir
# Device Side (Nerves)
1. Load embedded client certificate from firmware
2. Establish TLS connection to ThunderGate endpoint
3. Present client cert during TLS handshake
4. Wait for validation response

# ThunderGate Validation
1. Verify client cert chain against Crown CA
2. Check certificate revocation status (CRL/OCSP)
3. Lookup device record in ThunderBlock (cert fingerprint)
4. Validate device not in :revoked state
5. Create/update session in ThunderLink
6. Return success + policy manifest URL

# Policy Enforcement
1. Device downloads policy manifest from Crown
2. Cache manifest locally (SQLite/ETS)
3. Validate PAC actions against cached rules
4. Optional: Phone home to Crown for ambiguous cases
5. Emit telemetry for policy decisions (allow/deny/defer)
```

**Local Execution Model:**
```elixir
# Autonomous PAC Control Loop (runs on device)
defmodule NervesPAC.Runner do
  use GenServer
  
  def handle_info(:tick, state) do
    # 1. Check for local events (GPIO, sensor data, timers)
    local_events = collect_local_events(state)
    
    # 2. Evaluate against cached Crown policies
    {allowed, denied} = enforce_policies(local_events, state.policy_cache)
    
    # 3. Execute allowed actions locally
    execute_local(allowed)
    
    # 4. Queue telemetry for backhaul
    queue_telemetry(state, allowed ++ denied)
    
    # 5. Offload heavy compute to cloud if needed
    offload_requests = identify_heavy_compute(allowed)
    request_cloud_execution(offload_requests)
    
    # 6. Sync with cloud Thundra (if connected)
    sync_thundra_state(state)
    
    {:noreply, schedule_next_tick(state)}
  end
end
```

**Telemetry Backhaul (ThunderLink TOCP):**
- **Store-and-Forward**: Events queued locally, transmitted when connectivity available
- **Priority Queue**: Critical events (errors, policy violations) sent first
- **Compression**: Batched events compressed before transmission
- **Acknowledgment**: Cloud confirms receipt, device can prune local queue
- **Fallback**: If offline >24hrs, device writes to local SQLite for later sync

**OTA Update Flow:**
```elixir
# Orchestrated by ThunderGate
1. New firmware built, signed with Crown key
2. ThunderGate publishes firmware metadata to ThunderBlock
3. Devices poll for updates (or pushed via ThunderLink)
4. Device downloads .fw file, validates signature
5. Device applies update (A/B partition swap)
6. Device reboots into new firmware
7. Device re-enrolls via mTLS (proves update success)
8. ThunderGate updates device firmware_version in ThunderBlock
```

**Performance Optimizations (NIFs/Rust):**
- Image processing: Rust NIFs for CV pipelines (face detection, OCR)
- TensorFlow Lite: Rust bindings for on-device inference
- Signal processing: Rust NIFs for audio analysis (voice commands)
- Encryption: Rust crypto for secure local storage

## 🛡 Wave 0 "Secure & Breathe" Recap (Sep 26 2025)

Rapid stabilization slice delivered ahead of HC-08/HC-03 efforts:

- ✅ Secret hygiene restored – `.roo/` and `mcp/` paths ignored, leaked artifacts purged.
- ✅ `CODEBASE_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md` resurrected with up-to-date Ash 3.x + MCP checks.
- ✅ Secret handling doctrine codified in `README.md` with `.envrc.example` scaffolding.
- ✅ Gitleaks pre-push hook + CI action enforce PAT/secret scans (`./scripts/git-hooks/install.sh`).
- ✅ OpenTelemetry bootstrap guarded; missing `:opentelemetry_exporter` now downgrades to a warning.

Next tactical objectives (Wave 1 – "Breathe & Route"):

1. Re-wire `ThunderlineWeb.UserSocket` with AshAuthentication session tokens (`current_user` assign).
2. Stand up API key issuance (`mix thunderline.auth.issue_key`) and flip router guards to `required?: true`.
3. Reinstate Thunderblock vault / policy surfaces once actor context is dependable.
4. Resurrect Thunderbolt StreamManager supervisor + PubSub bridge with ExUnit coverage.

These line up directly with HC-05/HC-06 prerequisites and keep momentum toward M1.

## 🌊 Sensor-to-STAC Pipeline Overview (HC-24)

**Status**: Specification complete | Priority: P1 | Owners: Forge + Bolt + Block Stewards

### Purpose
Complete data pipeline transforming raw sensor observations from edge devices into tokenized knowledge graph contributions with economic rewards. Bridges Thunderforge (ingestion), Thunderbolt (orchestration), and Thunderblock (persistence/rewards).

### High-Level Flow
Nerves Device → Thunderbit → Decode Worker → Assembly Worker → PAC Validation (6 dimensions) → DAG Commit → STAC Minting → Staking (sSTAC) → Yield (STACC)

### Key Components
- **Thunderbit**: Signed data packet from edge sensors
- **Knowledge Item**: Assembled observation meeting PAC thresholds (5 types: Instruction, Milestone, Query, Observation, Metric)
- **DAG**: Knowledge graph storing items as nodes with causal/semantic edges
- **STAC**: Reward token (formula: R = Base × Quality × Novelty × Policy × StakeMultiplier)
- **sSTAC**: Staked STAC (governance rights)
- **STACC**: Yield certificate (tradeable)

### PAC Validation (6 Dimensions)
1. Relevance (goal alignment), 2. Novelty (anti-spam decay), 3. Crown Policy (governance), 4. Ownership (auth chain), 5. Integrity (signatures), 6. Cost Budget (resource limits)

### MVP Cut (2 Sprints)
Sprint 1: Thunderbit → DAG (no rewards). Sprint 2: Reward mechanics + staking.

## 🌿 SYSTEMS THEORY OPERATING FRAME (PLAYBOOK AUGMENT)

This Playbook is now bound by the ecological governance rules (see OKO Handbook & Domain Catalog augmentations). Each phase must prove *systemic balance* not just feature completeness.

Phase Acceptance Criteria now includes:

1. Domain Impact Matrix delta reviewed (no predation / mutation drift)
2. Event Taxonomy adherence (no ad-hoc event shape divergence)
3. Balance Metrics trend acceptable (no > threshold excursions newly introduced)
4. Steward sign-offs captured in PR references
5. Catalog synchronization executed (resource + relationship updates)

Balance Review Gate (BRG) is inserted at end of every major sprint; failing BRG triggers a `stability_sprint` (hardening, no net new features).

BRG Checklist (automatable future task):

- [ ] `warning.count` below threshold or trending downward
- [ ] No unauthorized Interaction Matrix edges
- [ ] Reactor retry & undo rates within SLO
- [ ] Event fanout distribution healthy (no new heavy tail outliers)
- [ ] Resource growth per domain within expected sprint envelope

## **🎯 CONCLUSION: We're In Perfect Sync!**

**Your vision is SPOT ON**, bro! The architecture you outlined is exactly what we need:

1. **ThunderBlock** → User onboarding & server provisioning ✅
2. **ThunderCrown** → AI governance & MCP integration 🔄
3. **ThunderBolt** → Orchestration & sub-agent deployment 🔄
4. **ThunderFlow** → Intelligent task routing ✅
5. **ThunderLink** → Communication & automation execution ✅ (Discord-style nav + auth online)

The foundation is **SOLID** - we've got the engine running clean, state machines working, and the core optimization algorithms ready. Now we need to build the experience layer that makes it all accessible to users.

**First milestone: Send an email** is PERFECT. It touches every part of the system without being overwhelming, and it's something users immediately understand and value.

Secondary near-term milestone: **Realtime authenticated presence + AshAI panel activation** to convert static chat surface into intelligent collaborative environment.

## ♻ CONTINUOUS BALANCE OPERATIONS (CBO)

Recurring weekly tasks:
1. Catalog Diff Scan → detect resource churn anomalies.
2. Event Schema Drift Audit → confirm version bumps recorded.
3. Reactor Failure Cohort Analysis → top 3 transient causes & mitigation PRs.
4. Queue Depth Trend Review → adjust concurrency/partitioning if P95 rising.
5. Steward Sync → 15m standup: edges added, invariants changed, upcoming DIP proposals.

Quarterly resilience game day:
- Simulate domain outage (Flow or Gate) → measure recovery time & compensation.
- Inject elevated retry errors → verify backpressure and no cascading fanout.
- Randomly quarantine a Reactor → ensure degraded mode still meets SLO subset.

Artifacts to archive after each game day: metrics diff, incident timeline, remediation backlog.
