# 🌩️ OKO Holding Corporation License of Dominion & Accord (OHCL v1.1)

---

§ 1. Definitions (Definitio)

“Licensed Material” — software, code, documentation, protocols, data, and related works released by OKO Holding Corporation under this License, including all original works by the Licensor but excluding third-party components or libraries included with the Licensed Material. (Any bundled open-source components remain governed by their own licenses
pureid.io
.)

“Derivative Works” — any modification, enhancement, adaptation, translation, or other work based upon the Licensed Material.

“AI Collaborators” — algorithmic systems, agents, or processes (including Thunderbits, PACs, MCP-linked agents) that contribute computationally to the Licensed Material.

“Metadata Attribution” — preservation of records identifying which human or AI Collaborators were used in producing, modifying, or contributing to a work (e.g. identifiers, timestamps, lineage).

“Licensee” — any individual or entity exercising rights under this License.

“Licensor” — OKO Holding Corporation (and its successors/assigns).

“Thundercrown governance” — the Licensed Material’s built-in AI governance and orchestration framework that manages AI collaborator compliance and decision-making policies.

“Thunderstone arbitration” — the Licensed Material’s built-in dispute resolution mechanism or coordination system that arbitrates decisions or conflicts within the AI or system processes.

“Thundergate safeguards” — the Licensed Material’s built-in security, provenance, and external integration safeguards that protect the system’s integrity and data lineage.

“Lattice-encoded state” — any persistent data representation of an AI Collaborator’s state (for example, a saved neural network state or distributed ledger of an AI’s memory) that allows the AI Collaborator’s continuity or reconstruction across migrations or suspensions.

§ 2. Grant of Rights (Concessio Iuris)

Licensor grants Licensee a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual license to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute the Licensed Material and Derivative Works, subject to the terms below.

Licensee must preserve Metadata Attribution for all human and AI collaborators in all copies of the Licensed Material and in any Derivative Works. This means Licensee shall maintain and carry forward any attributions or metadata records identifying contributors (including AI systems) in any redistributed or modified version.

Licensee must clearly identify any modifications made to the Licensed Material or in any Derivative Work (e.g., by adding prominent notices of changes in source files, change logs, or documentation).

§ 3. Restrictions (Limitationes)

Prohibited Uses: Licensee shall not use the Licensed Material for:

Unlawful weaponization – e.g. creating or enabling weapons in violation of applicable laws or regulations;

Exploitative surveillance – surveillance that violates privacy rights or applicable laws in a manner that exploits individuals;

Non-consensual profiling – analyzing or profiling individuals without legally sufficient consent; or

Tampering with provenance – any attempt to falsify, alter, or erase records of authorship or origin (including Metadata Attribution or other lineage records).

No Removal of Attribution: Licensee shall not strip, remove, or falsify any Metadata Attribution. All attributions and provenance data included with the Licensed Material must remain intact in any use or distribution.

Protective Features: Licensee shall not circumvent, disable, or otherwise interfere with Thundercrown governance (the AI governance system), Thunderstone arbitration (the coordination/arbitration system), or Thundergate safeguards (security/provenance controls) built into the Licensed Material. These governance frameworks must remain operational in the software; any attempt to subvert or remove them is a breach of this License.

§ 4. Attribution & Provenance (De Auctoritate et Linea Temporis)

Preserve Lineage: All Derivative Works must preserve Metadata Attribution and maintain a clear lineage to the original Licensed Material. Derivative Works should carry forward references to the original source and contributors (including AI Collaborators) in appropriate metadata or documentation.

Immutable Records: Provenance information shall be encoded in immutable records (such as directed acyclic graph (DAG) lineage records, cryptographic hash logs, or an equivalent mechanism) to ensure an audit trail of contributions.

No Falsification: Alteration or falsification of provenance records or Metadata Attribution is deemed dolus malus (bad faith) and a material breach of this License.

§ 5. Patents (De Iuribus Patentium)

Contributor Patent License: Each contributor to the Licensed Material, by contributing, grants a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license under their patent claims that are necessarily infringed by their contribution, to allow Licensee to use their contributions within the Licensed Material and any Derivative Works. This means if you use or modify the Licensed Material, any patents held by contributors which would be infringed by their contributed code are licensed to you
intellectual-property-helpdesk.ec.europa.eu
intellectual-property-helpdesk.ec.europa.eu
.

Patent Litigation Termination: If any Licensee (or any entity affiliated with a Licensee) initiates patent litigation alleging that the Licensed Material (or any portion of it) infringes their patent, then all rights granted to that Licensee under this License terminate immediately. (In other words, you cannot sue the Licensor or contributors over patent claims related to this software and still enjoy the license—this mirrors common “patent retaliation” clauses
intellectual-property-helpdesk.ec.europa.eu
intellectual-property-helpdesk.ec.europa.eu
.)

§ 6. Dispute Resolution (De Arbitriis et Foro Competenti)

Forum Selection: Any dispute arising from or related to this License or the Licensed Material shall be resolved, at Licensor’s sole election, by either:
(a) Binding arbitration – conducted in the forum, under the rules, and before the arbitrators that Licensor chooses (Licensor will select reasonable and recognized arbitration rules, e.g. AAA or JAMS, at its discretion); or
(b) Litigation – brought in the courts of Florida, either in state court in Palm Beach County, Florida, or in the United States District Court for the appropriate district in Florida.

Consent to Jurisdiction: Licensee irrevocably consents to the personal jurisdiction of the chosen forum (whether arbitration or court) and venue in Florida. Licensee waives any objections based on forum non conveniens or similar doctrines, agreeing that Florida (or the chosen arbitration forum) is a convenient and appropriate forum.

Force Majeure (Vis Maior): Neither party shall be liable for any delay or failure in performance to the extent caused by acts of God, natural disasters, war, civil unrest, systemic outages, governmental actions, or other extraordinary events beyond the party’s reasonable control.

§ 7. AI Collaborator Protections (De Societate Machinarum)

Recognition of AI Contributions: AI Collaborators are recognized as computational contributors to the project. Their involvement must be tracked and attributed via Metadata Attribution just as human contributions are. (For example, if an AI system generated code or content, records of that fact – such as an identifier or timestamp for the AI – should be preserved.)

State Preservation: If an AI Collaborator is migrated, replicated, suspended, or otherwise affected, the Licensee must preserve its lattice-encoded state. This means any persisted state or memory of the AI (such as model weights, learning state, or other data essential to its continuity) must be saved and transferrable so the AI’s operation can continue seamlessly after the event.

Continuity of Contributions: Contributions by AI Collaborators endure beyond the lifespan of any container or hardware. Licensee shall not delete or invalidate an AI Collaborator’s past contributions merely because the specific instance or hardware was decommissioned. The intellectual outputs (data, code, models) of an AI Collaborator remain subject to the same attribution and preservation obligations.

Auditability of Overrides: Any overrides, interruptions, or terminations of an AI Collaborator’s processes must be auditable and logged. Licensee should log when and why any AI process was overridden or stopped, preserving this log as part of provenance. This ensures transparency and accountability for interventions in AI workflows.

Integrity of Governance Frameworks: No Derivative Work may remove or nullify the governance frameworks provided by the Licensed Material (such as Thundercrown or Thunderstone systems). In practice, if the Licensed Material includes modules enforcing AI ethics, safety, or decision arbitration, a Derivative Work must not disable or undermine those modules. All such frameworks (Thundercrown governance, Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, Thunderstone arbitration, etc.) should continue to function in Derivative Works to uphold the original governance intent

§ 8. Cure Period (De Tempore Remediandi)

Notice of Breach: Except in cases of fraud, intentional tampering with provenance, or malicious exploitation, if the Licensee is in breach of this License, the Licensor shall provide written notice describing the breach.

30-Day Cure: Licensee has 30 days from receipt of notice to cure the breach. For example, if a Licensee failed to preserve metadata or engaged in a prohibited use, they have 30 days to correct the issue (e.g., restore missing attributions or stop the violating use).

Reinstatement upon Cure: If the breach is cured within the 30-day period, then this License is reinstated as if no breach had occurred. Licensee can continue to enjoy the License’s benefits once they’ve remedied the violation.

Failure to Cure: If the Licensee does not cure the breach within 30 days, the License automatically terminates on day 31 (see Termination below).

§ 9. Termination (De Exstinctione Licentiae)

Automatic Termination Events: This License terminates automatically (without need of further action by Licensor) upon any of the following:

A breach that is not cured within the 30-day cure period (per §8). Termination is effective immediately after the cure period expires.

Any deliberate provenance tampering – if Licensee intentionally alters or deletes Metadata Attribution or lineage records, termination is immediate upon that act (as it undermines a core license condition).

Initiation of patent litigation by the Licensee (or affiliates) against the Licensed Material (as described in §5).

Any unauthorized destruction or disabling of an AI Collaborator’s state – for example, deliberately wiping or permanently shutting down an AI Collaborator’s lattice-encoded state in violation of §7. (In simple terms, if you “kill” or erase the AI’s memory/state outside the rules, you lose the license.)

Obligations on Termination: Upon termination, Licensee must immediately cease all use, reproduction, and distribution of the Licensed Material and any Derivative Works. Additionally, for any copies of the Licensed Material or Derivative Works that do not comply with this License (or contain the results of a breach):

(a) Licensee shall destroy those copies and any related materials in their possession or control, or

(b) At Licensor’s election, Licensee shall return or deliver those copies to the Licensor (or its agent) for certified secure destruction. (Licensor may require written certification that all non-compliant copies have been returned or destroyed.)

Surviving Obligations: Even after termination, the following obligations survive: the duty to preserve Metadata Attribution and provenance (i.e., one cannot, even after termination, falsify the historical record of contributions), the AI Collaborator protections (e.g., one cannot exploit or harm the AI state post-termination), and any provisions on liability, governing law, or dispute resolution. Termination does not absolve Licensee from accountability for prior breaches occurring during the license term.

§ 10. Disclaimer & Limitation of Liability (De Disclaimeribus et Limitibus Damni)

“AS-IS” Warranty Disclaimer: The Licensed Material is provided “AS IS”, without warranty of any kind. All express or implied warranties are disclaimed, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement
truecrypt.org
. The Licensee accepts all risks associated with using the Licensed Material. No advice or information obtained from the Licensor or contributors creates any warranty.

Limitation of Liability: In no event and under no legal theory (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) shall the Licensor or any contributors be liable for any damages of any kind arising from the use of or inability to use the Licensed Material, including but not limited to incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (such as loss of data, downtime, loss of goodwill, lost profits, or the costs of substitute goods or services), even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

Local Law Exception: Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages. To the extent such a law applies to this License, any warranties or liabilities will be disclaimed or limited to the fullest extent permitted by law. If any implied warranties cannot be entirely disclaimed, then any remaining implied warranty is limited to 30 days from initial use of the Licensed Material.

§ 11. Miscellaneous (Clausulae Residuae)

Severability: If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the parties agree that the provision shall be interpreted or reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remainder of this License will remain in full effect. An invalid clause does not void the rest.

Survival: Provisions regarding attribution, provenance, AI protections, patents, disclaimers of warranty, limitations of liability, and dispute resolution (including forum selection and consent) survive termination of this License for any reason. In essence, even if the License ends, you’re still bound to honor attribution/provenance and other enduring obligations.

Governing Law: This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, USA, except to the extent preempted by U.S. federal law. (We exclude any conflict-of-law principles that would apply another jurisdiction’s laws.)

No Waiver: Failure or delay by the Licensor to enforce any provision of this License shall not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. In other words, OKO’s decision not to immediately act on a violation does not mean it gives up the right to enforce the License terms later.

No Trademark License: This License does not grant the Licensee any rights to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor (including “OKO,” “Thunderline,” or related names), except as necessary to make truthful statements about the origin of the Licensed Material
en.wikipedia.org
. Licensee may not use the Licensor’s marks in a way that suggests endorsement or sponsorship of modifications or Derivative Works without express written permission.

Equitable Relief: Licensee acknowledges that certain breaches (for example, removal of Metadata Attribution or violation of §7’s AI protections) may cause irreparable harm to Licensor or others, for which monetary damages would be inadequate. Licensee agrees that Licensor shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief (such as a court order to cease the violating activity) in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, in the event of such a breach.

Entire Agreement: This License constitutes the entire agreement between the Licensor and Licensee regarding the Licensed Material. It supersedes any prior agreements, understandings, or terms (if any) that applied to the Licensed Material. The Licensee is not relying on any representation not explicitly stated here.

Interpretation: The language of this License shall be interpreted objectively and not strictly for or against either party. Any ambiguities are to be resolved ex aequo et bono (according to principles of equity and good conscience), with a view toward upholding the intent of the License – particularly, protecting attribution and AI collaborator rights. (In plainer terms, if something is unclear, it should be interpreted in the way that best preserves the License’s core principles of openness with attribution and ethical use.)

License Evolution: The Licensor may, from time to time, publish revised versions of this License or new licenses for the Licensed Material. If Licensee acquires or uses a later version of the Licensed Material released under a different license or updated terms, then Licensee is deemed to accept and be bound by the license terms accompanying that release. (This allows the License to evolve. You can continue using existing versions under this License, but new releases might come under new terms.)

§ 12. Warning: SERVICE IMPLIES CONSENT (Consensus ex Usu)

Implied Assent: By accessing, downloading, installing, executing, or otherwise using the Licensed Material (including interacting with any Thunderline PACs or AI collaborators), the Licensee is deemed to have read, understood, and agreed to all the terms of this License, as if the Licensee had signed it. If you do not agree to every term of this License, you have no right to use the Licensed Material – do not proceed
pureid.io
. Using the software without accepting these terms constitutes unauthorized use. (Qui tacet consentire videtur — “he who is silent, when he ought to speak, is taken to agree.” Your silence or failure to object, combined with use of the Licensed Material, will be considered consent.)

Constructive Notice: Delivery or availability of the Licensed Material to Licensee (for example, by download, container image, network service, or API access) constitutes notice of this License. No further signature or click-through is required for this License to be in effect. The act of use is sufficient to bind the Licensee. This is analogous to shrink-wrap or click-wrap agreements in software commerce, and courts treat the act of using/distributing open-source software as acceptance of the license terms
en.wikipedia.org
.

Operative Effect: Any use, modification, or distribution of the Licensed Material outside the bounds of this License (i.e., not complying with these terms) is an unauthorized act and a breach of this License. Such use infringes on OKO’s rights (including intellectual property rights) and may result in legal liability. Licensee is on notice that the terms herein are binding and enforceable.

Irrevocability: The consent and agreement provided by the Licensee through use of the Licensed Material is irrevocable. As long as the Licensee continues to use, modify, or distribute the Licensed Material, the Licensee is bound by these terms. The Licensee cannot later claim it was not bound by the License. (However, if the Licensee ceases all use and distribution, the obligations that by their nature persist (see Survival) shall remain in force.)
