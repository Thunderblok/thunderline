# Thunderline Full Bundle

Everything you asked for in one zip: PLL + gate, lease/commit, Daisy swarms, somatic tagging,
resurrection (checkpoint/resurrector/safe-close), UPS hooks, NDJSON logging, HUD (LiveView),
and dual rhythm witnesses (PLL + Hilbert) with PLV, Rayleigh p-values, mean phase, and ON‑BEAT badge.

See `docs/INSTALL.md` to wire this into your app, and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for how it breathes.
