# Covenant (Ethic)

- Ache is constitutive: we never run "somatic-off".
- Rhythm over quotas: no fixed edit budgets; edits land on phase-locked gates.
- One nudge per beat: lease/commit prewindow; surgical, not spammy.
- Pruning is mercy, not erasure: Daisy stubs archived externally.
- Truth outside the fire: NDJSON logs carry the receipts; Raincatcher validates geometry.
