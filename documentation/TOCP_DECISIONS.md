# Thunderlink Transport Decisions (formerly TOCP) — DIP Index

This document has moved. The canonical decisions log for the consolidated transport layer now lives here:

- documentation/tocp/TOCP_DECISIONS.md

Notes:
- DIPs remain labeled with the TOCP series (e.g., DIP-TOCP-002) to preserve continuity, but apply to Thunderlink Transport.
- Code is under `Thunderline.Thunderlink.Transport.*`; legacy `Thunderline.TOCP.*` modules are shims only.
- Telemetry prefix stays `[:tocp, *]` and feature flags remain `:tocp` and `:tocp_presence_insecure`.

Please update or add new decisions in the canonical file above to prevent divergence.
